      <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
    </strong><br />• *NIX operating systems: Linux, Unix, OSX<br />• 1.14 &lt;= Bash shell &lt; 4.3 <br /> ◇ Bash 4.3 is
    been released in 24 September 2014 and in this time the last version of Debian was 6.0<br /> <br />CVE based on the
    Shellock vulnerability:<br /> ◇ <strong>CVE-2014-6271</strong> → This is the initial vulnerability, focused on the
    way that Bash handled functions being defined within environment variables and exported them to a child Bash process
    that would then import these functions as part of its environment. Parsing flaws in the way this was handled allowed
    for an adversary to introduce his own commands to be executed because Bash continued to accept input after the
    function definition was completed<br /> ◇ CVE-2014-6277<br /> ◇ CVE-2014-6278<br /> ◇ CVE-2014-7169<br /> ◇
    CVE-2014-7186<br /> ◇ CVE-2014-7187<br /><br /><br />CGI is a protocol designed to allow web servers to execute
    console-like programs directly on the server. These programs, known as CGI scripts, often handle data from dynamic
    webpages and interact over <a
      href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/http-request-request-methods-and-http-response-codes-0179947/" target="_blank">HTTP</a>.
    <br />A new directory, typically named cgi-bin or something similar, has to be designated to enable CGI scripts to
    run. When a browser requests the URL of a specific file contained within the CGI directory, the server runs the
    script, and the output is passed back to the browser.<br />When CGI scripts are run, specific information is copied
    to the environment variables. That information will subsequently be passed to Bash if it is called, thus providing a
    way for an attacker to inject malicious code. <br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography<br /><a
