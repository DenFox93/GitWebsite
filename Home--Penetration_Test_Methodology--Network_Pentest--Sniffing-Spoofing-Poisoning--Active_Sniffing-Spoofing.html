<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Active Sniffing/Spoofing</h1><br/>Active sniffing is performed by actively performing (malicious) operations (MAC flooding or ARP poisoning) on the network.<br />This means that we will inject packets on the network in order to redirect the traffic.<br />Differently from the Passive Sniffing is not a stealthy technique<br /><br /><strong><h3>Difference between Sniffing, Spoofing and Poisoning</h3></strong><br />• <strong>Sniffing</strong>: the attacker listens and capture networks’ data traffic<br />• <strong>Spoofing</strong>: the attacker use(impersonate) somebody else credentials(example:IP address) to create TCP/IP packets<br />• <strong>Cache Poisoning</strong>: the attacker manipulate the cache of a host/server introducing in it false records</div>
