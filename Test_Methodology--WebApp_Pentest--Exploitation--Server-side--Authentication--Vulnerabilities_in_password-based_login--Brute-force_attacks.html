      <h1>Brute-force attacks</h1>
    </strong><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Brute-forcing usernames</h3>
    </strong><br />Usernames are especially easy to guess if they conform to a recognizable pattern, such as an email
    address. For example, it is very common to see business logins in the format firstname.lastname@somecompany.com.
    <br />During auditing, check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. <br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Brute-forcing passwords</h3>
    </strong><br />Many websites adopt some form of password policy, which forces users to create high-entropy passwords
    that are, theoretically at least, harder to crack using brute-force alone. <br />We can use a basic knowledge of
    human behavior to exploit the vulnerabilities that users unwittingly introduce to this system. Rather than creating
    a strong password with a random combination of characters, users often take a password that they can remember and
    try to crowbar it into fitting the password policy. <br /><span style="color:#a52a2a;">example:</span>
    &quot;mypassword&quot; become Mypassword1! or Myp4$$w0rd<br />This knowledge of likely credentials and predictable
    patterns means that brute-force attacks can often be much more sophisticated, and therefore effective, than simply
    iterating through every possible combination of characters.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Username enumeration</h3>
    </strong><br />Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in the website&#39;s behavior in
    order to identify whether a given username is valid.<br />We should pay particular attention to any differences
    in:<br />◇ <strong>Status codes</strong>: During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be
    the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status
    code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct. It is best practice for websites to always return
    the same status code regardless of the outcome, but this practice is not always followed.<br />◇ <strong>Error
      messages</strong>: Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND
    password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect. It is best practice for websites to use identical,
    generic messages in both cases, but small typing errors sometimes creep in. Just one character out of place makes
    the two messages distinct, even in cases where the character is not visible on the rendered page.<br />◇
    <strong>Response times</strong>: If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate
    from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. This is another indication that the
    guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the
    username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. This may be subtle, but an
    attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticeably
    longer to handle.<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Bypass the IP-based brute-force protection</h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong>X-Forwarded-For</strong> header → could allow us to spoof the IP address and bypass the
    IP-based brute-force protection.<br /> The X-Forwarded-For header <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is
      usually set by a proxy</span>, but it can also be added by an attacker. By adding his own X-Forwarded-For header,
    the attacker can spoof his IP address. If the IP block is implemented incorrectly, it can be bypassed by putting an
    allowed IP address in the header, even if the connection actually originated from a blocked IP address<br /> ◇ Add
    this header in the response → X-Forwarded-For: §IPaddress§<br /> ◇ Here we can find a proxy list: <a
