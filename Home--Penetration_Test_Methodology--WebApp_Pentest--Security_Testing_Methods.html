      <h3>Security testing methods</h3>
    </strong><br /><br />• <strong>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</strong><br /> White Box Pentesting:
    Manual testing + use of Tools, with access to the source code <br /> ◇ Strengths: <br /> ▪ Identifies security
    deficiencies not readily apparent in deployed application<br /> ◇ Weaknesses: <br /> ▪ Requires access to source
    code<br /> ▪ Not all application security flaws are able to be easily identified with an automated analysis tool
    (This is particularly true of more complex flaws)<br /> ▪ The SAST tools, being dependent on source code, also have
    difficulty when applications have flaws due to leveraging external libraries or APIs to which the SAST tools have no
    access.<br /><br />• <strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</strong><br /> Black Box Pentesting: DAST
    tools(Web Application Security Scanners) identify security flaws through dynamic interaction with the deployed
    applications (not imply any access to source code)<br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Strengths</span>:<br /> ▪ Does not require source code access<br /> ▪ Can be
    automated/integrated into pipeline<br /> ▪ Scales well for large applications<br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Weaknesses</span>: <br /> ▪ Only as good as the tool, its configuration, and
    the user using it<br /> ▪ significant incidence of false positives<br /> ▪ Difficulty with certain types of flaws
    <br /> <span style="color:#ff8700;">DAST Tools</span>: best DAST scanning tool is the one you know how to wield
    effectively<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Free/Open Source</span>: ZAP Active Scan, SQLmap (SQL
    Injection specific), W3AF, Metasploit WMAP, WPScan (WordPress specific)<br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Commercial</span>: Acunetix Vulnerability Scanner, Burp Scanner, Fortify
    WebInspect, IBM AppScan, Qualys WAS, Rapid7 AppSpider, Veracode Dynamic Analysis, Whitehat Sentinel, ZAP
    Scan<br /><br />•<strong> Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)</strong> <br /> <a

    <br />•<strong> Out-of-band Application Security Testing (OAST):</strong> <br /> Use of external servers to see
    otherwise invisible vulnerabilities<br /> <a
