<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>shadow & passwd</h1><br/>1. Grab a copy of <span style="color:#1e90ff;">/etc/passwd</span><br />   ◇ Contains login names, UID numbers, and possibly password representations (if not shadowed)<br />   ◇ Readable by any account on system<br />   ◇ if we gain limited account access to a Linux/UNIX machine we can read only <span style="color:#1e90ff;">/etc/passwd</span> but from it we can determine if password representations are stored <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span> simply by looking at the second field of each line of this colon-delimited file. If there is an &quot;x&quot; or an &quot;*&quot; or a &quot;!!&quot; in this entry, the password for the given account is not present, possibly because it is not set or is located in <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span>.<br />    If the passwords are located in <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span>, the attacker then must access the target with UID 0 privileges to get a copy of <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span> for cracking<br />2. Grab a copy of <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span><br />   ◇ Contains password representations, security settings, and more<br />   ◇ Readable only by accounts with UID 0 <br />3. Combine the two together with script<br />   ◇ John the Ripper&#39;s unshadow script pulls account info from <span style="color:#1e90ff;">/etc/passwd</span> and password info from <span style="color:#ff1b00;">/etc/shadow</span>, creating one resulting file suitable for cracking<br />    <div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">unshadow&nbsp;/etc/passwd&nbsp;/etc/shadow&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;ourMergedFile</div></div></div>
