<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Session Fixation</h1><br/>Session fixation enables us to control what session ID a user is assigned instead of attempting to predict it. <br />The flaw is caused because the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">application assigns a session ID before authentication</span>.<br />Then, when the user authenticates, the application continues to make use of the same session token.<br />The attacker can then receive a session ID from an application and send it to the victim. When the victim clicks the link and authenticates, the attacker can then access the site using the same ID<br /><br /><strong>Discovering Session Fixation</strong><br />Discovering session fixation is actually quite easy. During the mapping phase of the testing, we should be looking for session tokens. We would then compare the ones we received before authentication to the ones in use after authentication. If the tokens are still being used, then session fixation may be possible.<br /><br /><strong>Exploiting Session Fixation</strong><br />1. Exploitation in the wild would involve convincing someone, usually via social engineering, to start with our known and fixed session ID. <br />2. Once the victim opens the link, the sessionID will be set to the known session ID. <br />3. Now the attacker is able to impersonate the victim session by changing his session ID<br /><br /></div>
