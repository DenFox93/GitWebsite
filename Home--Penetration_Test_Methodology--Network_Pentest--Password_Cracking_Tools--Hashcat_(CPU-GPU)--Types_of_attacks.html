<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Types of attacks</h1><br/>With the <code>-a</code> option we can select the the Attack mode:<br />• 0 →  <strong>Straight</strong>. This mode uses the dictionary words as they appear in their dictionary, with rules applied to them as specified by the <code>-r</code> option (if present).<br />• 1 →  <strong>Combination</strong>. This mode will take each word in the dictionary and append it to each word in the dictionary, essentially squaring the number of potential passwords from a word file. It will also apply the rules indicated by the <code>-r</code> option (if present) to the resulting combined words.<br />• 3 → <strong>Brute Force</strong>. This mode tries all potential passwords in a given keyspace, iterating through all characters.<br />• 6 → <strong>Hybrid + Mask</strong>. This mode uses a dictionary but then applies a brute force alteration against it, masking off certain characters of the original dictionary word to prevent changes</div>
