    <h6>Some applications make the </h6>
    <h6>mistake</h6>
    <h6> of assuming that the </h6>
    <h6>user and their data can be trusted indefinitely if they have passed initially strict controls</h6>.<br />
    <h6>If business rules and security measures are not applied consistently throughout the application, this can lead
      to potentially dangerous loopholes that may be exploited by an attacker</h6>
