<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>SQL injections(SQLi)</h1><br/>Web Applications store data that they process in some <strong>backend database</strong>. To interact with such database is used <strong>SQL</strong>(<strong>Structured Query Language</strong>)<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SQL injection(SQLi) allow to take control of </span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SQL statement</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> used by a vulnerable Web Application.<br /><br /></span><a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Databases.html">HERE</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> we can do a recap of how work SQL<br /></span><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>How it works</h3></strong><br />Many of the languages used to develop web applications implement an <strong>interpreter</strong>, example of the languages: SQL, LDAP, Perl, PHP<br />An <strong>interpreted language</strong> is one whose execution involves a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">runtime component</span> that interprets the language’s code and carries out the instructions it contains.<br />Because of how interpreted languages are executed, a <strong>family of vulnerabilities</strong> known as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">code injection</span> arises<br />Therefore, the <strong>code that the interpreter processes</strong> is a <span style="color:#ff8700;text-decoration:underline;">mix of the instructions</span> written by the programmer and the <span style="color:#00ff2d;">data supplied by the user</span>.<br />The result is that, <span style="color:#00ff2d;">part</span> of <span style="color:#ff8700;">this input</span> gets interpreted as program instructions, which are executed in the same way as if they had been written by the original programmer.<br />A successful injection attack that <span style="color:#ff8700;">modifies a query</span> (<span style="color:#00ff2d;">and not merely the data within the query</span>) can bypass the application’s discretionary access controls and gain unauthorized access<br /><br /><strong><h3>What we need to keep an eye on</h3></strong><br />While <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SQL injection is typically not found as commonly as before</span> (due to new changes such as PHP Data Objects (PDO), a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases types) it is still always worth testing for as they may be filtering certain characters to prevent SQL injection. <br />One thing to note is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">typically legacy code is more vulnerable to SQL injection</span> so keep an eye out for old features. <br />When <span style="text-decoration:underline;">testing for SQL injection yes you could simply use </span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#39;</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> and look for errors</span> but a lot has changed since the past &amp; these days a lot of developers have disabled error messages so<br /><a href="enetration_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Exploitation--Server-side--SQL_injections(SQLi)--Visibility_of_SQLi--Blind_SQLi_Blind_Timing.html">Sleep payload</a><strong>(Blind SQLi)</strong> usually will slip through any filtering.  As well as this it is easier to indicate if there is a delay on the response which would mean your payload was executed blindly. <br /><br /></div>
