But these terms do have different meanings and profoundly different implications for testers. <br /><br /><strong><h3>PRO &amp;CONS</h3></strong><br />• <strong><span style="color:#ff1b00;">Password guessing</span></strong> involves formulating a guess for a password and then trying to use that guess to actually log in to a target system, either locally or across the network.<br />   ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">generate a lot of log entries</span> if the system is logging failed login attempts, as well as network traffic that an Intrusion Detection System analyst may see<br />   ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">could also lock out accounts</span> if the system is configured to disable accounts after a threshold of bad login attempts<br />   ◇ It tends to be many orders of magnitude <span style="text-decoration:underline;">slower than password cracking</span>. The timing of password guessing depends on the speed of the target system in processing login attempts, as well as the performance of the network. Some target systems even throttle their authentication speeds when a single connection or user tries too many passwords in a short time. The speed of password guessing attacks may range from approximately one guess per minute to one guess per second<br />• <strong>Password cracking</strong> attack, the attacker gets a copy of the encrypted or hashed password representations either from a target machine or by sniffing them off of the network. The attacker then cracks the passwords by formulating a guess, encrypting or hashing the guess, and then comparing the result to the actual password&#39;s encrypted or hashed value. If the encrypted guess equals the encrypted password, the attacker now has a usable password.<br />   ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">happens on the attacker&#39;s machines</span>(one or more systems controlled by the attacker), thus <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stealthier</span>. It generates far less information in logs and in network captures (although there may be some records of the theft of the encrypted/hashed passwords, depending on how the attacker snags them)<br />   ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not lock out accounts</span> because the attacker is not using the password guesses to attempt to log in.<br />   ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is faster</span>, can go through huge numbers of guesses quickly. The attacker may cycle through tens of thousands to many millions (or more) of guess/encrypt/compare actions every second.<br /><br />While in <strong>password cracking</strong> (using John the Ripper for example) the time needed to test a single password is given by the processing time;<br />during a <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">network </span></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">authentication cracking attack</span> also called <span style="color:#ff1b00;text-decoration:underline;">Password Guessing</span>, the time needed to test a password depends on many other factors<br /><br /><br /><strong><h2>Password Spray</h2></strong><br />A type of <span style="color:#ff1b00;">password guessing</span> attack is the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Password Spray</span> attack where you use a single password with a list of users. <br />To make a password Spray attack we can use:<br />   ◇ <a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Password_Cracking_Tools--Network_Authentification_cracking--Hydra--ssh.html">Hydra</a><br /><br /><strong><h2>How to use Password Guessing<br /></h2></strong>Given the danger of account lockout, before proceed with Password Guessing test:<strong><br /></strong>1. ask the target environment administrators if account lockout functionality is in use.<br />    To be sure ask them to run the commands:<br />    <div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">net&nbsp;accounts/domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#from&nbsp;an&nbsp;account&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;member&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;domain</div></div><br />    <div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">grep&nbsp;tally&nbsp;/etc/pam.d/*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#on&nbsp;Linux/UNIX</div></div><br />2. To have the confirm about Account Lockout settings, ask to the target organization staff to create one or more test accounts for the penetration testing team and provide userIDs and passwords.<br />    Before any password guessing attacks are launched, the penetration testing team tries to lock out these accounts by attempting 100 bad login attempts in a short time, such as over a minute or two(default Lockout observation window is 30 minutes). <br />    Then, the team tests whether the account has been locked out by trying to use it to log in. <br />    If the account still works, then in all likelihood the target environment does not have account lockout functionality<strong><h2><br /><br />Common Passwords format in the companies<br /></h2></strong>• [Season][year]<br />   ◇ Spring2018 <br />   ◇ Autumn 2020<br />• [Month][year]<br />   ◇ July2015<br />   ◇ November2014<br />• [CompanyName][number]<br />   ◇ Google21<br />   ◇ Facebook44<strong><br /></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
