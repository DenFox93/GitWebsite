    <h1 class='title'>ICMP redirect attack</h1><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>ICMP redirect</h3>
    </strong><br />ICMP is the short for Internet Control Message Protocol. The protocol is in charge for providing
    information exchange between systems.<br />It is used in pings,tracing-route, and other functionalities informing
    the user of the current state of systems and links.<br /><br /><strong>ICMP redirect</strong> is in charge to keep
    the hosts using the best gateway available,or to switch in case of failure.<br />It <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">is sent by bridges to inform the hosts that a better gateway is
      available</span> to communicate with a specific destination.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>ICMP redirect attack</h3>
    </strong><br />Unlike ARP spoofing where the attacker pretends to be the target host in the hopes of getting frames
    re-directed to them on the LAN, ICMP redirect attacks modify the routing table of victim hosts, by misleading
    victims that they provide a better metric to the target destination outside the LAN. This redirection causes the
    victim hosts to update their routing table and insert “better priority” gateway alternatives through the attacker’s
    host instead to reach the destination network.<br />By forging packets, the hosts will update the routing table by
    registering a new default route, passing through the attacker&#39;s system(gateway)<br /><span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">How address this issue</span><br />Disable ICMP redirect messages, on the
    hosts, or on the nodes of the network (it canbe individually disabled for specific interfaces).<br /><br /><span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Scapy</span><br />To forgery the packets, Scapy can be used. <br />It is a
    Python packet manipulation library. The first instantiation represent the victim address and the source from which
    it receives the packet. Then the gateway&#39;s (fake) address is added. Finally, the second IP instance represents
    the route, here the packets for 2.0.0.1. A new route is added on the server, it is a poisoned route to the client,
    with the attacker&#39;s machine as the best gateway.
