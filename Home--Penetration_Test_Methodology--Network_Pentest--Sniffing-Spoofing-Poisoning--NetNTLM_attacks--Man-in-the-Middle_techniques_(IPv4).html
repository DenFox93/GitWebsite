<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Man-in-the-Middle techniques (IPv4)</h1><br/><strong><h3>Use Man-in-the-Middle techniques in order to sniff the client response</h3></strong><br /><br />1. To do that the tester would have to be located at a spot in the network through which these exchanges are transmitted.<br />2. After sniffing the exchanges the attacker needs to crack the authenification protocol used (LANMAN Challenge/Response, NTLMv1, NTLMv2 or Microsoft Kerberos)<br /><br /></div>
