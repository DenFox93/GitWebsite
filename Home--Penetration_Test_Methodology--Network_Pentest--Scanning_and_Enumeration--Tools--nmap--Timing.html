<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Timing</h1><br/><strong>Nmap&#39;s Timing Options</strong><br />Nmap has various options for scan speed built in, invoked with the -T syntax<br /><div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">nmap&nbsp;-T&nbsp;[timing_option]&nbsp;<span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400">[</span>other&nbsp;options<span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400">]</span></div></div><br />   ◇ 0 →  Paranoid mode: It sends packets approximately every 5 minutes. designed to scan so slowly that it will avoid detection by IDSs, falling outside of their time-sampling window. No packets are sent in parallel with a Paranoid scan; they are sent one at a time<br />   ◇ 1 →  Sneaky mode: it sends packets every 15 seconds. no parallel sending(scans serially)<br />   ◇ 2 →  Polite mode: 0.4 seconds between packets. no parallel sending(scans serially)<br />   ◇ 3 →  Normal mode: Default, designed to not overwhelm network or miss targets/ports, scans in parallel (using -T3 changes nothing because it is the default)<br />   ◇ 4 →  Aggressive mode: Waits only 1.25 seconds for probe response, scans in parallel. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">-T4 is recommend when scanning reasonably modern and reliable networks</span>. However, some penetration testers use the default normal mode (-T3) to lower the chance of impairing the target network.<br />   ◇ 5 →  Insane mode: Spends up to 15 minutes per host (gives up on that host and moves on if scan taking longer for it), waits only 0.3 seconds for probe response, scans in parallel</div>
