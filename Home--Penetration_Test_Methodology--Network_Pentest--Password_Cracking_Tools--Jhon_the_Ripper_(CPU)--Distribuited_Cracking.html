<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Distribuited Cracking</h1><br/><a href=""><img src="images/738-1.png" alt="images/738-1.png" /></a><br /><br />John the Ripper does support parallel password cracking across multiple CPUs or multiple machines via the OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) API and the MPI (Message Passing Interface) distributed architecture. <br /><br />We could have multiple instances of John work on the same password by having each target a different potential password length. We could have one John instance working on passwords of N characters, another on N+1, another on N+2, and so on. <br />In the John configuration file (john.conf on Linux/UNIX systems and john.ini on Windows), there is a section for Incremental mode cracking, specified with the &quot;[Incremental:&quot; header in the file. For the All, Alpha, Digits, and Alnum (alphanumeric) sections of the file, we could specify a MinLen = N and a MaxLen = N. With the same N, that instance of John will make guesses of only that length.<br />    <a href=""><img src="images/738-2.png" alt="images/738-2.png" /></a><br />    <br />Then each John instance could run out of a single mounted file share (using Windows file sharing, SAMBA, NFS, or another sharing mechanism) on each of the cracking machines, storing their results in the exact same john.pot file.<br />Multiple instances of John can do this, provided that you launch each John with a different session identifier string, using --session=[string] at the command line. Then just monitor this john.pot file for the answer when it is eventually cracked.</div>
