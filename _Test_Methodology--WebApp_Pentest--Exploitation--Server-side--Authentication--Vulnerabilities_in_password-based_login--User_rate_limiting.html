    <h1 class='title'>User rate limiting</h1><br />To prevent brute-force attacks, Website can apply <strong>user rate
      limiting</strong>. <br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Too many login requests within a short period of
      time causes your IP address to be blocked.</span><br />Usually the IP can be unblocked in one of the following
    ways:<br /> ◇ After a certain period of time<br /> ◇ By an administrator<br /> ◇ By the user after successfully
    completing a CAPTCHA<br /><br /><strong>User rate limiting</strong> is sometimes <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">preferred by the Administrators</span> of the Webiste to <a
      href="er-side--Authentication--Vulnerabilities_in_password-based_login--Flawed_brute-force_protection--Username_enumeration_via_Account_locking.html">Account
      Locking</a> due to being less prone by Attackers to username enumeration and denial of service attacks.
    <br /><br />If the limit is based on the rate of HTTP requests sent from the user&#39;s IP address, it is sometimes
    also possible to bypass this defense by <strong>guess multiple passwords with a single
      request.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br /><a
