      Enumeration</strong><br /><a
      href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OTG-IDENT-004)" target="_blank">https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OTG-IDENT-004)</a><br />The
    scope of this test is to verify if it is possible to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the
    authentication mechanism of the application. <br />This test will be useful for brute-force testing, in which the
    tester verifies if, given a valid username, it is possible to find the corresponding
    password<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Account Lockout Web Applications</strong><br />• Most web applications are
    designed to be high performance. <br />• Account lockout exists for large/public web applications such as Google
    Mail but is unusual for the types of web applications used by most web application penetration testing
    clients<br />• Web servers are often poorly monitored<br /><br /><strong>Differences in the response between good
      username/bad password and bad username/bad password</strong><br />• <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Different HTML responses</span>: The website tells you “bad username” when the
    username is incorrect, and “bad password” when the username is correct but the password is not<br /> ▪
    &quot;Incorrect Username…&quot; – bad username<br /> ▪ &quot;Incorrect Password…&quot; – bad password<br /> ◇ This
    is a bad security design but is sometimes intentionally configured as an overt attempt to lower the total cost of
    ownership (TCO) of user support by limiting help desk calls<br />• Different response variables:<br /> ▪
    example.com/logon.php?reason=0 → bad username<br /> ▪ example.com/logon.php?reason=1 → bad password<br />• Forms
    that repeat a good username on refresh, while a bad username is blank<br />• There are sometimes subtle differences
    in the returned HTML<br /> ◇ Tools like Burp Comparer can discover these<br />• Response timing differences <br /> ◇
