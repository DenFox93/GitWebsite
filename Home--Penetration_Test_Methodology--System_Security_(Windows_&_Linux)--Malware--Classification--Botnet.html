<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Botnet</h1><br/><br />Bots need to be installed on internet connected machines to perform a DDoS(Distributed Denial of Service) or they are used serving as spamming sources.<br />These Bots that form a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Botnet</span> are commanded remotely by a <strong>Command and Control</strong>(C&amp;C) server. This <span style="text-decoration:underline;">C&amp;C</span> can instruct bots to perform a given operation simultaneously.<br />The controller or owner of the botnet is called a botmaster and is usually the one who gives commands to the bots.<br /></div>
