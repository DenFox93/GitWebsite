<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fuzzing DNS</h1><br/><br />Fuzzing is a method for finding new vulnerabilities in any piece of software or technology through the injection of random or invalid input for the purpose of causing a fault to occur.<br />In DNS this is done by creating pseudorandom DNS queries, altering the composition of UDP packets, and flooding the target name server to cause software faults.<br />When fuzzing DNS, you might take that service offline, but it is desirable to know exactly which packet or query caused the issue so that the problem can be explored further and the issue re-created. To do that we need Wireshark running in the background.<br /><br />Existing DNS software(like BIND) have already been extensively fuzzed but would be interesting if we come across to a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">custom DNS service</span><br /><br /><strong>Fuzz with nmap</strong><br /><div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">nmap&nbsp;-sU&nbsp;--script&nbsp;dns-fuzz&nbsp;--script-args&nbsp;timelimit=2h&nbsp;&lt;IpDNS&gt;&nbsp;-p&nbsp;53</div></div><br />    remember to run Wireshark in the background so if the Server crash, we could try reproducing the effect by sending the last packet sent before the crash again to see if it is a reproducible issue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• “Hands on Hacking: Become an Expert at Next Gen Penetration Testing and Purple Teaming” Matthew Hickey, Jennifer Arcuri<br /></div>
