    <h1 class='title'>Metamorphism</h1><br />Metamorphism can be also defined as polymorphism with polymorphism applied
    to the decryptor/header<br />There are different ways to implement metamorphism:<br />• <strong>Garbage
      Insertion</strong><br /> Garbage data/instructions are inserted into the code, e.g.: NOP instructions (0x90) are
    inserted<br />• <strong>Register Exchange</strong><br /> The registers are exchanged in all the instructions<br />

    this type of mutation, code blocks are randomly shuffled and then fixed up, so that the execution logic is still the
    same<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/579-2.png" alt="images/579-2.png" /></a><br />• <strong>Insertion of jump
      instructions</strong><br /> Some malware mutate by inserting jumps after instructions (the instruction is also
    relocated), so that the code flow does not change<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/579-3.png"

    one instruction (or set of instructions) are replaced by 1 or more different instructions which are functionally
    equivalent to the replaced set.<br />• <strong>Code Integration with host</strong><br /> the malware modifies the
    target executable( which is being infected) by spraying its code in regions of the
    EXE.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
