<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Hashing algorithms</h1><br/>Linux and UNIX use salted* password hashing algorithms. because of the use of the salt bit* the guess-encrypt-compare cycle of password cracking is more difficult to do in advance to create a precomputed dictionary because the attacker would not know which salt to fold into the encryption step in advance.<br />(*A salt is a bit of randomness folded into a crypto algorithm to make attacks against it more difficult. Because an attacker does not know what a given account&#39;s salt will be in advance, he will have to work harder to crack a password when the password hashes are stolen)<br /><br /><strong><h3>Crypt(3) function</h3></strong><br />Most Linux and UNIX systems create their password representations using the <strong>crypt(3)</strong> routine. There are different crypt routines, crypt(3) has the 3 number because of is described in Section 3 of the man pages.<br />• The crypt(3) function takes as its input a user&#39;s password and a random salt<br />• The length of the salt differs for different versions of Linux and UNIX<br />• The crypt function outputs a text string using standard ASCII characters</div>
