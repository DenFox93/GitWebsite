<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Browsing Anonymously</h1><br/><br />We need to find a service that provides anonymity, as you will NOT get it for FREE.<br />Anytime you send traffic through another person/companies computers to hide yourself, you are exposing all data you see to that person/company as they can sniff the data.<br />Therefore, use extreme caution and do not use any systems that you do not own, or that you do not know what information they capture</div>
