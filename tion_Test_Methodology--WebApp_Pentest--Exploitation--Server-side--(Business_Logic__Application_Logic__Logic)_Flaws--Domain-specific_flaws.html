      purpose of the site<br /><br /><br />• Attention to any situation where
      <strong

      check whether the order was changed after the discount is applied. An

      threshold, then remove the items they don&#39;t want before placing the
      order.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br />•
