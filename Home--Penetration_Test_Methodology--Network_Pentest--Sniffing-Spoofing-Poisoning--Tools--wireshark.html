<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>wireshark</h1><br/><br />Wireshark is a network sniffer and protocol analyzer. We can use it to analyze packets, traffic stream, or connections that hits the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NIC</span>(<strong>N</strong>etwork<strong> I</strong>nterface <strong>C</strong>ontroller but also called Network Interface Card,LAN adapter or physical network interface) of our computer<br />A Network Interface Card (NIC) can work in two mode:<br />      • <strong>promiscuous mode</strong>: accept and process every packet it receives also if they are addressed to others NICs(and so other MAC addresses)<br />         ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ethernet</span>: because the networks are switched, sniffing traffic on Ethernet is harder than WiFi<br />            ▪  ARP poisoning<br />            ▪  MAC flooding<br />         ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">WiFi</span>: detect traffic for other hosts is more easy on WiFi because is necessarily broadcast <br />      • <strong>monitor mode</strong>: accept only packets addressed to its NIC(and the the correspondent MAC address)<br /><br />Analyze packets with Wireshark <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">using a normal account user(no root)</span></strong>. Because Wireshark is known to be vulnerable to specially crafted malformed packets.<br />Running Wireshark as root (aka admin) puts you at a higher risk level. </div>
