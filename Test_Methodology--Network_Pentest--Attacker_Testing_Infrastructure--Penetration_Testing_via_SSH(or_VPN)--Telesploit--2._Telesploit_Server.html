    <h1 class='title'>2. Telesploit Server</h1><br /><br />site: <a

    It support ARM( so also RaspberryPi) or Intel<br />• It is been thought to work with Kali Linux <br /> ◇ Anyway it
    support different OS, the important thing is that the OS have <strong>systemd</strong>, a software suite that
    provides an array of system components<br /> ◇ with KaliLinux 2020.1 you are not by default root but an unprivileged
    user, first we have to unlock root.<br /> ◇ From here: <a
      href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/" target="_blank">https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/</a>
    we can download the “raspberrypi foundation” image (kali 2020.1 tested)<br /> ◇ When we have to wipe and reimage the
    “dropbox” for another customer, instead of re-setup every single time Kali we can use FOG project(<a
      href="https://fogproject.org/" target="_blank">https://fogproject.org/</a>) .<br /> When we have an already setup Kali Linux
    image(<span style="color:#f6ff00;">gold image</span>) on a “dropbox” we can do a PXE boot(network boot) and capture
    the <span style="color:#f6ff00;">gold image</span> on the FOGG server and after it we can reimage this <span
      style="color:#f6ff00;">gold image</span> on other “dropboxs” or the same “dropbox”<br /> *When we setup Kali Linux
    image for the first time, do a <a href="https://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-partition.html" target="_blank">manual install</a>
    and limit the system partition for example to 64GB and the other partition for data, otherwise with the
    &quot;guided-use entire disk&quot; install the entire disk will be allocated to Kali Linux. This mean that with the
    guided install if we have 1TB of storage we have to backup 1TB over the network, with 64GB instead is more
    faster.<br />• When the Telesploit server device boots a USB storage must be connected, because the server collects
    some data(network etc.) and encrypt them in a PGP file and save it on USB. <br /> If the Telesploit Server does not
    come up on the Telesploit Relay this file can be useful for the Penetration Tester(that have the key to decrypt
    it)<br />• The customer have to whitelist the connection<br /><br /><br />
