<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Security Pitfalls Implementing Cryptographic Systems</h1><br/><br /><strong><h3>Attacks against Implementations</h3></strong><br />Most of the times, an attacker will not directly attack the cryptographic algorithms. They instead attack their implementation.<br />How implement a cryptographic algorithm correctly:<br />• Not destroying plaintexts after use<br />• Not dealing with decrypted data( if we do, we have to do it carefully)<br />    <span style="color:#a5452a;">example:</span> A system using temporary files to avoid data loss, might leave plaintext or decrypted data or both in the temporary file<br />• System using more than 1 key, should take care of all keys equally, because a single key leak renders the complete system useless.<br />• Allowing recovery of old keys can also act as a weak point<br />• ...<br /><br /><strong><h3>Attacks against Password</h3></strong><br />Many systems break because they rely on user-generated passwords that usually are not very strong.<br />Dictionary attacks work very well when the dictionary is targeted to the environment, country, age and language of the target<br /><br /><strong><h3>Attacks against Trust Models</h3></strong><br />Usually systems use Trust modules(like seen for the <a href="on_Test_Methodology--System_Security_(Windows_&_Linux)--Cryptography_and_Password_Cracking--Cryptography--Public_Key_Infrastructure_(PKI).html">Public Key Infrastructure</a>) to verificate that the system they are communicate with is trustable.<br />Attackers can exploit trust that the target give to other systems.<br /><span style="color:#a5452a;">examples:</span><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">e-mail program</span>: unless the public keys are certified by a trusted source (and unless that certification can be verified), the system is vulnerable<br />    also if it use crypto algorithms to encrypt messages<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">website</span>: sometime trust data for a website come from a database, what if we gain access to the database?<br /><br /><strong><h3>Attacks on the Users</h3></strong><br />Users are the weakest link of the chain. <br />With Social Engineering in combination with phishing websites or installed malware; cryptography or password strength are useless.<br /></div>
