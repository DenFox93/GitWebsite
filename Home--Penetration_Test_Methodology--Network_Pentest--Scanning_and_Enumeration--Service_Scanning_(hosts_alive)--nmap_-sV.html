    <h1 class='title'>nmap -sV</h1><br />When Nmap identifies an open port, it displays the default
    <em><strong>service</strong></em> commonly associated with that port by consulting the <span
      style="color:#00ff00;text-decoration:underline;">nmap-services</span> file, which lists approximately 2,200 common
    services and the well-known ports that they use<br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">updatedb<br />locate&nbsp;nmap-service-probes<br />gedit&nbsp;/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services
      </div>
    </div><br />Anyway we can also consult the official port assignment list maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers
    Authority (IANA) <a
      href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml" target="_blank">https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml</a><br /><br />For
    open TCP and UDP ports, Nmap probes the target by sending a variety of <em><strong>packets</strong></em> defined in
    the <span style="color:#ff8700;text-decoration:underline;">nmap-service-probes</span> file. There are more than
    1,000 signatures in this file, which are highly useful in determining various kinds of target services based on
    their network behavior. Nmap also attempts to conduct an SSL handshake over open TCP ports, and if SSL is supported,
    it then probes the target port across the SSL connection to get version information<br /><span
      style="color:#ff8700;text-decoration:underline;">nmap-service-probes</span> → In that file, lines that start with
    &quot;Probe&quot; indicate the messages to send to target services, whereas lines that start with &quot;match&quot;
    indicate the response text to look for when identifying the given service.<br />

      </span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">service detection</span> scan, used to detect what
    <strong>version of service</strong> is running on a particular port, not stealthy but useful (-sS is setted by nmap
    by default).<br /> When we know the version of a service, we can search online for vulnerabilities for that specific
    version of the service or we can download the software and run it locally to identify vulnerabilities that can be
    exploited<br /> ◇ hosts that are UP<br /> ◇ ports: state, service and <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">version of the service</span><br /> ◇ MAC address<br /><br />-sV has some
    options that we can set:<br /> <strong>--version-intensity &lt;intensity&gt;</strong>: The <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">higher the number, the more likely it is the service will be correctly
      identified</span>. However, high intensity scans take longer. The intensity must be between 0 and
    <small>9</small>. The default is 7<br /> <strong>--version-light</strong>: alias for --version-intensity 2. This
    light mode makes version scanning much faster, but it is slightly less likely to identify services.<br />
    <strong>--version-all</strong>: alias for --version-intensity 9, ensuring that every single probe is attempted
    against each port<br /> <strong>--version-trace</strong>: debugging info about what version scanning is doing. It is
    a subset of what you get with --packet-trace
