    most SQLi tools, does not seem to be actively maintained(last update 2018)<br /><br />BBQSQL provides a Python-based
    framework targeting the discovery and exploitation of blind SQL Injection flaws.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>BBQSQL employs two attack techniques </h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong>Binary search </strong><br /> It serves as the default technique and works by splitting the
    expected character set to be returned in half. For example, return true if the first character of the result is
    greater than m. If false is returned, then the first character is less than or equal to m, and BBQSQL would then
    split a–m in half and ask the next question.<br />• <strong>Frequency search</strong><br /> Based on frequency
    analysis of letters occurring in English text. This can prove extremely fast if the dataset queried is standard
    English text, as opposed to numeric, a hash, or a random collection of characters.<br /><br /><br /><br />Whether a
    binary or frequency search is employed, BBQSQL can be configured to look for differences indicative of true/false
    across a wide number of values. These include looking at the timing of response, HTTP headers, content returned,
    size of data returned, HTTP status codes, encoding, cookies, and
    such.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
