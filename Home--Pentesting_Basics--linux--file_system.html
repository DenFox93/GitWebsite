    <strong>/sbin</strong> are where are stored executable programs<br />• <strong>/root</strong> is the root login
    account&#39;s home directory. This is hugely important because if you log in directly as root, this will be your
    initial location in the directory structure. If you log in as an individual user other than root, you&#39;ll be put
    in that user&#39;s directory, typically somewhere inside of /home.<br />• <strong>/dev</strong> stores devices
    (drives, terminals, etc.).<br />• <strong>/etc</strong> holds configuration items, like the account information
    (stored in /etc/passwd) and hashed passwords (stored in /etc/shadow).<br />• <strong>/home</strong> contains
    users&#39; home directories.<br />• <strong>/lib</strong> contains common libraries.<br />• <strong>/mnt</strong> is
    where various remote and temporary file systems (CD-ROMs, floppies, etc.) are attached.<br />•
    <strong>/proc</strong> is a virtual file system used to store kernel info.<br />• <strong>/tmp</strong> is for
    temporary data and is usually cleared at reboot.<br />• <strong>/usr</strong> holds user programs and other
    data.<br />• <strong>/var</strong> holds many different items, including logs (/var/log/).<br />•
    <strong>/opt</strong> stores optional items and is often a location for specialized tools that have been added to a
    distribution.<br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
