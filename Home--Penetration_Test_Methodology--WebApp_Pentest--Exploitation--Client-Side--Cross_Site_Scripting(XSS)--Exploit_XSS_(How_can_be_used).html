    <h1 class='title'>Exploit XSS (How can be used)</h1><br />The traditional way to prove that you&#39;ve found
    a cross-site scripting vulnerability is to create a popup using the alert() function. It&#39;s simply a way to prove
    that you can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a given domain. <br />Sometimes we want to prove to our clients that an
    XSS vulnerability is a real threat by providing a full exploit. <br /><span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Anything a legitimate user can do on a web site, you can probably do too with
      XSS</span>. Depending on the site you&#39;re targeting, you might be able to make a victim send a message, accept
    a friend request, commit a backdoor to a source code repository, or transfer some
    Bitcoin.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
