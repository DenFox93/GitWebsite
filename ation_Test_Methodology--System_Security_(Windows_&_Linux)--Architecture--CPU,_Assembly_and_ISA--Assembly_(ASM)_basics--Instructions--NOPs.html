<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>NOPs</h1><br/><strong><h3>No OPeration instruction(NOP)</h3></strong><br />NOP is an assembly language instruction that does nothing. When the program encounters a NOP, it will simply skip to the next instruction. In Intel x86 CPUs, NOP instructions are represented with the hexadecimal value 0x90<br /><br /><strong><h3>NOP-sled</h3></strong><h3> </h3><strong><h3>in Buffer Overflows</h3></strong><br />NOP-sled is a technique used during the exploitation process of Buffer Overflows. Its only purpose is to fill a large (or small) portion of the stack with NOPs; this will allow us to slide down to the instruction we want to execute, which is usually put after the NOP-sled. The reason is because Buffer Overflows have to match a specific size and location that the program is expecting.<h3><br />    </h3><a href=""><img src="images/484-1.png" alt="images/484-1.png" /></a><br />    </div>
