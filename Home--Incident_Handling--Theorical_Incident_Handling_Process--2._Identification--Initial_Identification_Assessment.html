    we find a vulnerability ask yourself these questions:<br />• How widely deployed is the affected platform or
    application?<br />• What is the effect of vulnerability exploitation?<br />• What is the value of the systems
    impacted so far? What is the value of the data on those systems?<br />• Can the vulnerability be exploited remotely
    (via a network connection)?<br />• ls a public exploit available? Was one recently released?<br />• What level of
    skill and prerequisites are required by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability?<br />• Is the vulnerability
    present in a default configuration?<br />• ls a fix available for the
    vulnerability?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Collection of techniques used by actual malicious attack groups</strong>: <a
