<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Gateway Poisoning</h1><br/>With this type of attack the attacker can sniff all the packets that pass from the internal network to the internet, to do that the attacker have to masquerade as the gateway. <br /><br />The Attacker&#39;s machine that want to sniff the outgoing traffic from the network will send Gratuitous ARP replies to the hosts of the internal network, announcing his MAC address as the MAC address of the default gateway for the network.<br />   In this way the attacker can get all the data destined to the outside of the network and pass it to the real gateway.<br /><br />To do a Gateway Poisoning the Attacker&#39;s machine should be able to process a big amount of packets/second otherwise an unintentional Denial of Service can occur in the network if the machine is too slow to forwarding the packets</div>
