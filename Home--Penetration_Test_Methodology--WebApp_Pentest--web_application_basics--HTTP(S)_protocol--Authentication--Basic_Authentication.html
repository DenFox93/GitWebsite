    <h1 class='title'>Basic Authentication</h1><br /><br />Basic Authentication was one of the first forms of
    authentication for the web. It was defined in RFC 2617 (Originally defined in RFC 1945) and has a number of
    problems. First and foremost, the username and password are transmitted over the network using a simple Base64
    encoding, which is trivial to reverse<br /><br /><strong>Encode in Base64</strong><br />1. Takes each 3-byte chunk
    and converts it to four printable ASCII characters using character set of 10 numbers, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, +,
    and /<br /> ◇ 10 + 26 + 26 + 2 = 64<br />2. Pads to 3 bytes using = sign<br /><br /><strong>HTTP ”Basic&quot;
      Authentication process</strong><br />1. Client requests a page.<br />2. The server sends back a 401 status code,
    which indicates that the client needs to authenticate.<br />3. The client sends the request again for the page but
    this time includes the authentication information input by the user. The username and password are encoded using
    Base64 (not encrypted)<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/123-1.png"

      Authentication</strong><br />• Basic Authentication has NO concept of:<br /> ◇ Account lockout<br /> ◇ Maximum
    number of login attempts<br />• Plaintext authentication, easily sniffable if not passed via HTTPS<br />• Can easily
    be replayed<br />• Impersonating the website to dupe browsers into providing authentication credentials<br />• No
    logout functionality without closing the browser
