    logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit
    unintended behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a
    malicious goal. <br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span>: As the rules of how  the application
    operates aren&#39;t always directly related to a business, the associated vulnerabilities are also known as
    &quot;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application logic vulnerabilities</span>&quot; or simply &quot;<span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Logic flaws</span>&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>Logic Flaws and Automated
      Scanners</strong><br />Logic Flaws are often overlooked because of the difficulty of discovering them. The
    difficulty in discovering these types of flaws is particularly true for automated scanning tools. One of the major
    challenges faced by automated tools in discovering these flaws is lack of understanding the context of an
    application<br /><br /><strong>Logic Flaws: Workflow Tampering</strong><br />Find any functionality that has an
    expected flow and break it down into its constituent parts. Once the typical workflow and steps are understood, we
    can attempt to subvert them in various ways.<br /><br /><strong>Logic Flaws: Manual Discovery</strong><br />Because
    as said earlier every automated scanning tool has tremendous difficulty in identifying these flaws. Manual testing
    for and discovery of these flaws will typically be required if this type of testing is part of the
    engagement.<br />Burp Repeater, with its interception proxy capabilities, often seems particularly well suited for
    manual logic flaw testing<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">OWASP Test cases to identify business logic
