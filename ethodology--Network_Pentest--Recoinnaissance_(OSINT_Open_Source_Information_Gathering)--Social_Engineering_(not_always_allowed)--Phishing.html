    <h1 class='title'>Phishing </h1><br /><strong>How to discover Phishing Email</strong><br />We have to check the
    Headers of the email and check if they are suspicious, to do that(in Gmail):<br /><a href=""><img
        src="images/982-1.png" alt="images/982-1.png" /></a><br />Below we have a some suspicious Headers:<br />•
    <code>Return-Path</code>: See if the email address in this entry matches the email address in the From: entry. They
    typically will not match for mass emailers like advertisers or spammers. The Return-Path: email address is used when
    an email cannot be delivered to its recipients, and it “bounces back”. Spammers don’t want all the undelivered email
    to end up in their inboxes!<br />• <code>Reply-To</code>: See if the email address in this entry matches the email
    address in the From: entry. When you hit reply to an email, the Reply-To entry is used to populate the recipients’
    email. If it is different, you may accidentally send your reply to someone else.<br />• <code>X-Distribution</code>:
    if this field’s value is bulk. This indicates bulk/spam email.<br />• <code>X-Mailer</code>: field indicates the
    email client. If it includes weird names, be suspicious.<br />• Bcc or X-<code>UIDL</code>: entries exist. This is a
    sign of poorly crafted header. They are never in normal emails!<br />• <code>X-Spam score</code>,
    <code>X-Spam flag</code> and <code>X-Spam status</code> entries help determine “spamminess”. But the scores are not
    standardized across servers so these have to examine on a case by case basis.<br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br />•
