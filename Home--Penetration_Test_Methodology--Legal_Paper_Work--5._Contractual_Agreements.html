    <h1 class='title'>5. Contractual Agreements</h1><br />This is the part of legal paperwork<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Statement of Work (SOW)</h3>
    </strong><br />Before you offer Penetration services, you may need to write a Statement of Work (SOW) that outlines
    the work you are going to perform<br />To writing a Statement of Work (SOW) check the <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--3._Project_Scope.html">Project Scope</a> that you
    agreed with the Client<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Master Services Agreement (MSA)</h3>
    </strong><br />Drawn up by Lawyer. A good example of a complete MSA from Rapid7: <a
      href="https://www.rapid7.com/legal/msa/" target="_blank">https://www.rapid7.com/legal/msa/</a><br />• It is absolutely vital that
    you get a <span style="text-decoration:underline;" >Permission to test</span> (called also <strong>Permission
      Memo</strong> or &quot;Get Out of Jail Free Card&quot; aka GOOJFC ) from a leader of the target organization
    giving us the permission to test its environment. <br /> As a starting point we can use this sample memo: <a
      href="http://www.counterhack.net/permission_memo.html" target="_blank">http://www.counterhack.net/permission_memo.html</a><br />
    *Permission Memo and Rules of Engagement are two different things<br />• We have also include a <strong>limitations
      of liability agreement</strong> that caps the liability for any damage associated with the penetration test at the
    price of the project itself. <br /> Thus if the penetration test cost 50000$ the limitation of the liability
    agreement caps the liability at that value.<br /> In addition we can get a <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">professional insurance</span>(sometime required by the clients) that covers
    errors and omission from the penetration testing team. Common insurance levels range between 1$-5$ million<br />•
    <strong>Contract</strong><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Follow the Law</h3>
    </strong><br />• When performing testing a country where we have not tested before, we have to consult our
    lawyer.<br />• The tester has to follow not only the laws where he or she is located but also the laws in the
    country where the target machines are located<br /> ◇ Sometime also the laws of the states(such USA) that the the
    packets of our traffic traverse<br />• The text of the cybercrime laws of more than 100 countries is been gathered
    here: <a
      href="https://www.unodc.org/cld/v3/cybrepo/legdb/" target="_blank">https://www.unodc.org/cld/v3/cybrepo/legdb/</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)</h3>
    </strong><br />Because during the pentesting work we can came across confidential data, company usually ask to sign
    a <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)</span></strong>. With that
    company ensures that we will not divulge any information.<br /><br />
