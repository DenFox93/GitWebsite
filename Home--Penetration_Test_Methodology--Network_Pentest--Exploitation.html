<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Exploitation</h1><br/><br />In this phase we verify if a vulnerabilities really exists and if is possible exploiting them.<br />so what we have to do:<br />   • checks and validates vulnerability<br />   • widen of the attack surface increasing privileges on the target hosts and/or network<br /><br /><strong>exploiting a host</strong> helps to discover new targets in its network and so we can repeat the process from the Information Gathering phase. The penetration test is a cycle process that ends when there are no more systems and service to exploit<br /><a href="file://C:/CherryTree/screenshot/Penetration Testing/cycle.png"><img src="images/148-1.png" alt="images/148-1.png" /></a><br /><br /><strong><h3>Test against a Production environment?</h3></strong><br />If we have to testing against a Production environment, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">first we should test the exploit inside a VM</span>.<br />The VM have to run the same version of software as your target. We need to monitor the attack carefully with a tool like Wireshark and explore the effects of your attack on the VM afterward.<br />If we are running the attack against the client’s Test environment, then wireshark may not be necessary. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>RCE</h3></strong><br /><strong>Remote code execution</strong> occur when an user is able to execute operating system&#39;s commands on the remote system.<br />The code execution is rarely a vulnerability on its own rather is a result of different vulnerabilities that allow the execution of OS commands <br />  <br /></div>
