<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Keylogger</h1><br/>Malware which records every keystroke on the remote victim machine. Like Rootkit they need to be configured wisely to not be stopped by firewall.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Common operations:</span><br />• Recording keystrokes<br />   ◇ login information: can be used to exploit a system<br />   ◇ chat and emails: can be used to mount targeted and social engineering attacks<br />• Recording the window name where the victim user was typing<br />• Saving the keystrokes in a log file on the victim machine<br />• Sending the logs to a server controlled by the penetration tester<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Classification of Keylogger:</span><br />• <strong>Software keylogger</strong>:<br />    kernel mode or user mode keyloggers; firmware based keylogger can be put in the BIOS.<br />• <strong>Hardware keylogger</strong>:<br />    PS/2 and USB keyboards can be sniffed with an additional device placed between the keyboard port and CPU.<br />• <strong>Wireless keyboard sniffer</strong>:<br />    Passive sniffers can be used to collect keyboard data in case of wireless keyboards<br />• <strong>Acoustic Keylogger</strong>:<br />    These kinds of keylogger are based on the sound made when a key is struck by the user<br />• <strong>Optical keylogger</strong>:<br />    done by a person/camera that watch the keyboard<br /><br /><strong><h2>Software Keylogger</h2></strong><br />Malware working at the Kernel level by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hijacking the operating system APIs</span> to record keystrokes.<br />Normally when a key is pressed an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">interrupt</span> is called which in turn call a function that actually performs the operation intended for the key.<br />When instead a Keylogger is installed the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">interrupt</span> will first call the Keylogger that logs the key pressed and then it will call the original function<br /><a href="file://C:/CherryTree/screenshot/System/Keylogger.png"><img src="images/369-1.png" alt="images/369-1.png" /></a><br /><br /><strong><h2>Hardware Keylogger</h2></strong><br />USB devices that can be installed between keyboard and computer. They log keystrokes into an internal memory. <br />Less common than the software keylogger they can be used by a penetration tester while performing physical security tests.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/369-2.png" alt="images/369-2.png" /></a><br /><br /></div>
