    <h1 class='title'>BloodHound</h1><br />A Windows environment can be very big and complex, because of that for
    Administrators can be very difficult to retain a good overview of how privileges are assigned across the
    environment.<br />We can use BloodHoundAD, a single page javascript application with GUI, that generates a diagram
    of active sessions and relationships in the active directory to spot excessive privileges, which can be used in
    lateral movement.<br />For Red Teamers BloodHound can be a very noisy tool(both in the logs that in Active
    Monitoring), for them a tool like <a
      href="https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1" target="_blank">PowerView</a> of Powesploit
    can be more useful. Anyway for Penetration Testers, Blue Teamers and System Administrator can be a very useful
    tool<br /><br /><br /><a
