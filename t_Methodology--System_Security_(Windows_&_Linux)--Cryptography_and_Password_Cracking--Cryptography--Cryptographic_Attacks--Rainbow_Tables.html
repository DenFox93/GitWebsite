    <h1 class='title'>Rainbow Tables</h1><br />Rainbow Tables <span style="text-decoration:underline;">have pre-computed
      plaintext keys in </span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">their corresponding
        ciphertext(hashes)</span></strong><br />Store each hash of every plaintext takes an amount of memory which
    simply does nott exist. Because of that Rainbow Tables use chains to achieve a compromise between pre-computation
    and memory usage. <br />For a given number of possible passwords the increase of the <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Chain Length</span> means:<br />• decrease of the memory usage → because there
    are more links between hashtext and plaintext<br />• increase of the computation time → when we find the chain that
    maybe contain the <span style="color:#ff8700;">hashtext</span> we have to reduce and hash until we find a
    match<br /><span style="color:#a5452a;">example 1:</span><br />A rainbow table with 10 chains of length 100 → we
    have hashed 1000 plaintexts<br /><span style="color:#a5452a;">example 1:</span><br />A rainbow table with 10 chains
    of length 200 → we have hashed 2000 plaintexts<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Rainbow Tables and Dictionaries</h3>
    </strong><br />Dictionaries(hash tables) are good for common passwords, Rainbow Tables are good for tough(random)
    passwords. <br />The best approach would be to recover as many passwords as possible using dictionaries. For those
    that remain, use Rainbow Tables.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Reduction function</h3>
    </strong><br />A hash function maps plaintexts to hashes, the reduction function maps hashes to plaintexts<br /><a

      <h3>Chains</h3>
    </strong><br />The chains which make up rainbow tables are chains of one way hash and reduction functions starting
    at a certain plaintext, and ending at a certain hashtext. <br />The table only stores the starting plaintext, and
    the final hash you choose to end with after obtaining enough chains; but taking the reduction function and hash
    function into account all other intermediates values can also be determined<br /><br /><a href=""><img

      <h3>Searching in a rainbow table</h3>
    </strong><br />With a rainbow table we do a search for the ciphertext(hashed text) within the database of the
    rainbow table. If there is a match we go to the start of the chain and start hashing until there is a
    match<br /><br /><a

      <h3>Eliminate Collision and Loop problems from Rainbow Table</h3>
    </strong><br />The reason they&#39;re called Rainbow Tables is because each column uses a different reduction
    function. If each reduction function was a different color, and you have starting plaintexts at the top and final
    hashes at the bottom, it would look like a rainbow (a very vertically long and thin one).<br />The use of multiple
    reduction function reduce the possibility of Collision for two chains. In fact two chains to collide and merge they
    must hit the same value on the same iteration.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/556-4.png"
        alt="images/556-4.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />• <strong>Collision</strong> → A given hash may be generated by
    multiple plaintexts, which is a big problem for Rainbow Table chains because it causes chains which start different
    to converge into one.<br /> This mean that a hashing algorithm that generates collisions fairly regularly will be
    more secure.<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/556-5.png" alt="images/556-5.png" /></a><br />•
    <strong>Loops</strong> → They are caused when a hash is reduced to a plaintext that was hashed at a previous point
    in the chain<br /><a href=""><img src="images/556-6.png"
