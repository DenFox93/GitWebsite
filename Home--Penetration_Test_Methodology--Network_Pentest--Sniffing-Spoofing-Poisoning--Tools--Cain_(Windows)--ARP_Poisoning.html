In order to ensure that the packet gets back to the host, APR will broadcast the packet to all hosts on the LAN.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Half-Routing</span> → means that APR is only routing traffic on one side of the connection (either client to server, orserver to client), but not both sides.<br />There are a couple of reasons this can happen:<br />   ◇ One of the two hosts cannot be poisoned.<br />   ◇ Asymmetric routing is used on the LAN.<br />In this state, APR is limited in that it cannot grab any authentications that use challenge response mechanisms for proper authentication. More than likely, the Poisoned system is still using the correct destination MAC address, so the traffic is bypassing the attacker system.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Full-Routing</span> → this state means that APR is routing traffic successfully both ways, and all authentication will be captured accordingly.</div>
