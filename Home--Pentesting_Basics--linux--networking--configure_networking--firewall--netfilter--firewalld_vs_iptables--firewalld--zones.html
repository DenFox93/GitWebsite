      <h2>Basic Concepts in Firewalld</h2>
    </strong><br />• The firewalld daemon manages groups of rules using &quot;zones&quot;.<br />• Zones are sets of
    rules dictating what traffic should be allowed depending on the level of trust you have in the networks your
    computer is connected to.<br />• Network interfaces are assigned a zone.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>Zones</h2>
    </strong><br />The pre-defined zones within firewalld are, from least trusted to most trusted:<br /><br />•
    <strong>drop</strong>: The lowest level of trust. All incoming connections are dropped without reply and only
    outgoing connections are possible.<br />• <strong>block</strong>: Similar to drop, but instead of simply dropping
    connections, incoming requests are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited or icmp6-adm-prohibited message.<br />•
    <strong>public</strong>: Represents public, untrusted networks. You don’t trust other computers but may allow
    selected incoming connections on a case-by-case basis.<br />• <strong>external</strong>: External networks in the
    event that you are using the firewall as your gateway. It is configured for NAT masquerading so that your internal
    network remains private but reachable.<br />• <strong>internal</strong>: The other side of the external zone, used
    for the internal portion of a gateway. The computers are fairly trustworthy and some additional services are
    available.<br />• <strong>dmz</strong>: Used for computers located in a DMZ (isolated computers that will not have
    access to the rest of your network). Only certain incoming connections are permitted.<br />• <strong>work</strong>:
    Used for work machines. Trust most of the computers in the network. A few more services might be allowed.<br />•
    <strong>home</strong>: A home environment. It generally implies that you trust most of the other computers and that
    a few more services will be accepted.<br />• <strong>trusted</strong>: Trust all of the machines in the network. The
    most open of the available options and should be used sparingly.<br /><br />
