    <h1 class='title'>Dictionary Attacks</h1><br /><br />Attacks that use a dictionary of common most likely
    keys<br /><br />Especially for symmetric key algorithms where keys are selected by users, this approach can work
    better than the Brute force attack.<br /><br />The key stored in the dictionary are in cleartext so the tool that we
    use to do a dictionary attack need to encipher every key<br />Different cleartexts can produce the same cipher but
    it’s not important to know which the exact text, as long as it produces the same cipher. <br />In fact the check is
    done between ciphers and not between cleartexts.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Dictionaries sources</h3>
    </strong><br />Some keys dictionaries can be installed on kali linux with<br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">apt-get&nbsp;install&nbsp;seclists</div>
    </div><br />after the installation we will find the dictionaries in
    <strong>/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/</strong><br /><a href=""><img src="images/555-1.png"
        alt="images/555-1.png" /></a><br /><br />Below we can find a comprehensive wordlists with passwords leaked from
    various sources. <br />We can get several of these password lists and put them together into a single large file
    that we can use for password cracking attacks<br />• <a
