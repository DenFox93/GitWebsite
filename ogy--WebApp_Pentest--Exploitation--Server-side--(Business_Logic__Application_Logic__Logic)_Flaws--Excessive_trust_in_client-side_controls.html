    <h1 class='title'>Excessive trust in client-side controls</h1><br /><br /><br />A fundamentally flawed assumption is
    that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interface. <br />However, an attacker can
    simply use tools such as Burp Proxy to tamper with the data after it has been sent by the browser but before it is
    passed into the server-side logic. This effectively renders the client-side controls
    useless.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br /><a
