    <h1 class='title'>Security Implementations</h1><br />To prevent, the exploitation of vulnerabilities such as Buffer
    Overflow these are some security implementations<br />• <strong>Address Space Layout Randomization
      (ASLR)</strong><br /> When ASLR is activated, the OS loads the same executable <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">at different locations in memory</span> every time(at every reboot)<br /> This
    makes more difficult for an attacker to predict memory addresses and causes exploits to fail and crash the
    process<br /> Even if an application has ASLR enabled, there could be a linked DLL(library) in the address space
    without this protection which could make the application vulnerable to the ASLR bypass attack.<br />• <strong>Data
      Execution Prevention (DEP):</strong><br /> DEP is a defensive hardware and software measure that prevents the
    execution of code from pages in memory that are not explicitly marked as executable. The code injected into the
    memory cannot be run from that region; this makes buffer overflow exploitations even harder<br />• <strong>Stack
      Cookies (or Canary):</strong><br /> This is a security implementation that places a value next to the return
    address on the stack.<br /> The function <span style="color:#1e90ff;">prologue</span> loads a value into this
    location, while the <span style="color:#ff0000;">epilogue</span> makes sure that the value is intact. <br /> When
    the <span style="color:#ff0000;">epilogue</span> runs and checks that the value is incorrect a Buffer Overflow has
    probably taken place.<br /> This is because a buffer overflow usually overwrites data in the
    stack.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Process Explorer </strong><br />Download: <a

    this program on Windows we can verify if the Security implementations are enabled on a program<br /> *on Windows 7
    to install it is necessary the update: Security Update for Windows 7 (KB2758857)<br /><a href=""><img
