    <h1 class='title'>LM algorithm</h1><br /><strong>LANMAN</strong>: LM(LAN Manager) hash<br />It is the oldest
    password storage used by Windows. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">LANMAN was turned off by default starting
      in Windows Vista</span>, but might still linger in a network if there older systems are still used. It is possible
    to enable it in later versions through a GPO setting (even Windows 10). LANMAN hash is extremely weak, whereas the
    NT hash is stronger but not great<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How LM hash is created starting from
      user&#39;s password:</span><br />1. user&#39;s password is converted to uppercase, weakening the password
    representation because the attacker doesn&#39;t need to guess the case properly to crack the password<br />2. if
    length<br /> ◇ is less than 14 bytes → it&#39;s null-padded(NULL bytes added)<br /> ◇ more than 14 bytes → Windows
    simply stores encrypted padding for that user&#39;s LANMAN hash, making the LANMAN hash useless for an attacker
    because he can not dehash it to recover the password<br />3. it is split into two 7-byte, weakening another time the
    password because an attacker can crack the two halves independently of each other(faster to crack).<br />4. each of
    these 7-byte(56 bit) half is converted in a 64 bit DES key. To do that fill the remaining 8 bits, a parity bit is
    inserted after every seven bits<br />5. Each of the 64bit DES keys is used to DES-encrypt the constant ASCII string
    “KGS!@#$%”, resulting in two 8-byte ciphertext values<br />6. These two ciphertext values are concatenated to form a
    16-byte value, which is the LM hash<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/731-1.png"
