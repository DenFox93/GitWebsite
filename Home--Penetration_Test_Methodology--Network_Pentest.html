    <h1 class='title'>Network Pentest</h1><br /><br />In this chapter we will see which is my personal methodology to do
    an Internal Penetration Test on a Network and simulating hacker-like attacks<br />Internal Penetration testing
    requires the analyst to have physical access to the target organisation’s network, as opposed to external
    penetration testing which is carried out from the Internet.<br /><br />An internal penetration test emulates the
    role of an attacker from inside the network. A penetration tester will scan the network to identify potential host
    vulnerabilities and perform common and advanced internal network attacks, such as: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and other
    man- in-the-middle attacks,token impersonation, kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, golden ticket, and more. The
    penetration tester will seek to gain access to hosts through lateral movement, compromise domain user and admin
    accounts,and exfiltrate sensitive data<br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• <a
