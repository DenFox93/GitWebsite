      style="text-decoration:underline;">contract</span> is similar to creating a class in any other language. It’s a
    block of associated code that can be inherited, or interfaced with and contains its own variables and
    methods<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>constructor</strong><br />constructor () public payable → The <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">constructor</span> is run one time at contract creation and used to setup any
    variables or details of the smart contract. This is often used for creating an administrator of the contract or
    other items that are needed prior to contract usage.<br /><br /><strong>Solidity visibility types</strong><br /> ◇
    Public → This allows anyone to call and use this function<br /> ◇ Private → This allows only the current contract
    and its functions to call it directly.<br /> ◇ Internal → This is similar to private except it also allows derived
    contracts to use its functionality<br /> ◇ External → External can only be called externally by other contracts
    unless the “this” keyword is used with the function call.<br /><br /><strong>function types</strong><br />•
    payable:<br /> ◇ function → allow to receive ether while being called<br /> ◇ constructor → we can send a base
    amount of Ether to the contract when its deployed. This will add an initial monetary liquidity for whatever
    functionality the contract is providing. For example, if this were a gambling game, we would need some initial
    Ethereum to payout our winners before our revenues catch up with our payouts and we start collecting large sums of
    failed gambling revenue.<br />• returns → is simply the way the function denotes that it will return a value to the
    user<br />• view → this type of function does not modify or change the state of the contract but may return values
    and use global variables.<br />• pure → a pure function is a function which is completely self-contained in that
    does not access other variables that are external of the function and it does not change the state of the smart
    contract<br /><br /><strong>Execute function Hello()</strong><br />After we haave deployed the file, we can execute
    the function. This is the result<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1392-1.png" alt="images/1392-1.png" /></a><br /> ◇
    CALL → In solidity there are call and send transactions. The difference between the two is whether they change the
    state of the blockchain or not. In this case we did not change the state, we only retrieved information so a CALL
    was issued. If we were changing variables and sending values then a SEND transaction would have been issued
    instead.<br /> ◇ From → address which should correspond with the address you used to call the transaction. <br /> ◇
    To → field should be the address the smart contract was given when you deployed the smart contract. You can view
    this on your deployment screen next to the deployed contract name by hitting the copy button and pasting it
    somewhere to see the full value.<br /> ◇ Transaction cost &amp; Execution cost → You will then see the costs and gas
    associated with the transaction. Costs change based on the size of the contracts and the assembly code created by
    the compiler. Each instruction has a cost. We will cover that later when we do a bit of debugging and decompiling.
    <br /> ◇ Decoded Output → in this scenarion contains the return string “Hello World”<br />
