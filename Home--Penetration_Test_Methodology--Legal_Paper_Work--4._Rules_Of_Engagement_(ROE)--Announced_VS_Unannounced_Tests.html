<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Announced VS Unannounced Tests</h1><br/><br /><strong>Announced Test</strong>: inform of the penetration testing the system administrators, security team, hunt team, and incident handlers of the target is <br /><strong>Unannounced Test</strong>:  measure response to an attack of system administrators, security team, hunt team, and incident handlers <br />   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PRO</span><br />   ◇ we can find if some admins are purposely running backdoors or side businesses on the servers(otherwise they will likely temporarily shut off their shifty activities during the test duration)<br />   ◇ we can evaluate the detection and response mechanisms and processes of the target organization<br />   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">CONS</span><br />   ◇ The system or network administrators might detect the attack and start shunning the traffic(blocking the connections), blocking it from reaching the target systems. So if we proceed with an Unannounced Test we have to make sure the system and network administrators are watched to verify that no shunning occurs; otherwise will be a waste of time and money. In that scenario we have to clear what happen now:<br />      ▪ if system/network admins or IDS/firewall respond to the penetration test by shunning, will this conclude the testing?<br />      ▪ if NOT conclude the testing, we need additional approval to continue the penetration test?<br />   <br /><br />         <br /><br />      </div>
