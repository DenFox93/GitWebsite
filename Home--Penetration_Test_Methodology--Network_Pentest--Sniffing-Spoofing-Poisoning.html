    <h1 class='title'>Sniffing/Spoofing/Poisoning</h1><br />Network <strong>eavesdropping</strong>, or network
    <strong>sniffing</strong>, is a <a
      href="Home--Pentesting_Basics--networking--protocols--protocol_layers--IP_protocol_suite_(TCP-IP)--Internet_Layer-Internet_Protocol_(IP).html">internet
      layer</a> attack consisting of capturing packets transmitted by others computers.<br /><br /><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub" target="_blank">Hubs</a>: obsolete and replaced by switches. <br /> They are
    layer 1 (Physical layer) devices that do not deal with packets, but just with bits.<br /> Hubs are used in 90&#39;s
    as repeaters, they receive electric signals on one port and repeat the same signal on all the other ports, this mean
    that packets originally meant for one machine are received by all the other machines.<br /> <br /><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank">Switches</a>: they gradually replaced Hubs<br /> They are
    layer 2 devices (some more sophisticated are considered Layer 2-3 switches), capable of dealing with frames instead
    of just bits.<br /> Switches are capable of forwarding frames only to the real destination or at least forward the
    packet on the port on which the destination is registered<br /> <br />With the introduction of switches, sniffing
    became more difficult!<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Difference between Sniffing, Spoofing and Poisoning</h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong>Sniffing</strong>: the attacker listens and capture networks’ data traffic<br />•
    <strong>Spoofing</strong>: the attacker use(impersonate) somebody else credentials(example:IP address) to create
    TCP/IP packets<br />• <strong>Poisoning</strong>: usually called Cache Poisoning, the attacker manipulate the cache
    of a host/server introducing in it false records<br /><br /><br />Sniffing Tools are covered in depth in SANS
    Intrusion Detection In-Depth course, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SANS Security 503</span>, which
    focuses on packet analysis
