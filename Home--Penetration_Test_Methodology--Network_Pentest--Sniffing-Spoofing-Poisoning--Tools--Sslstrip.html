    <h1 class='title'>Sslstrip</h1><br />sslstrip is a MITM tool that implements Moxie Marlinspike&#39;s SSL stripping
    attacks<br />SSL stripping is a technique by which a website is downgraded from https to http. This is also known as
    SSL downgrading.<br /><br />1. The attacker first performs a MITM attack on the connection between the victim and
    the server. <br />2. Users don’t typically come to SSL-secured sites by typing in a full URL or using a bookmarked
    https://url. <br /> Many arrive via a redirect (like the HTTP 302 redirect) or an HTTP site which provides a link to
    the secured site. <br />4. The attacker intercepts the insecure HTTP request from the victim and creates an
    independent, legitimate connection to the destination server through HTTPS protocol<br />5. When attackers receive
    the server’s response on port 80, the attacker redirect it to the listen port of the SSL Stripping tool(default
    10000) that send the response to the victim in unencrypted format, posing as the server<br /><a href=""><img

      <h2>SSLSTRIP DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE... DIFFERENT TOOLS?</h2>
    </strong><br /><strong>sslstrip will in summary:</strong><br />• proxy all the communications between the victim and
    the server<br />• provide a visual feedback like &quot;secure lock&quot; icon near the url to provide familiar
    visual confirmations<br />• NOT getting SSL Certificate errors normally associated with MITM attacks on SSL
    Traffic<br />• logs all traffic passing through, so passwords, credentials etc. are stolen without the victim
