<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>-sU: UDP scan</h1><br/>Nmap also supports UDP scanning, but note that we don&#39;t have as many options as we do with TCP scanning, moreover these scans are much slower and more difficult to conduct than TCP scans.<br />For most of the ports Nmap sends simple UDP packets but for the most common UDP services/ports, Nmap sends a protocol-specific payload in its UDP packet, designed to get the target service to send a UDP response back.<br />Note that these payloads are sent only to those ports associated with the common UDP services. If someone has altered a standard UDP service to listen on an unusual port, this technique will not find it because only a UDP packet without a payload will be sent to the unusual port. However, it is exceedingly rare to find a production network with a standard UDP service listening on an unusual port.<br />Some of these commons services are:  7 (echo), 53 (domain), 111 (rpcbind), 123 (ntp), 137 (netbios-ns), 161 (snmp), 500 (isakmp), 1645/1812 (radius), 2049 (nfs)<br /><span style="color:#a5452a;">example:</span><br />    <div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">nmap&nbsp;-sU&nbsp;10.50.97.5&nbsp;--top-ports&nbsp;20</div></div><br />        <a href=""><img src="images/616-1.png" alt="images/616-1.png" /></a><br /><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Probe Response</th><th>Assigned State</th></tr><tr><td>Any UDP response from target port (unusual)</td><td>open</td></tr><tr><td>No response received (even after retransmissions)</td><td>open|filtered</td></tr><tr><td>ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3)</td><td>closed</td></tr><tr><td>Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, code 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13)</td><td>filtered</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/616-2.png" alt="images/616-2.png" /></a><a href=""><img src="images/616-3.png" alt="images/616-3.png" /></a><a href=""><img src="images/616-4.png" alt="images/616-4.png" /></a><br /><br /><strong>port filtered</strong><br />filtered<strong> </strong>means that nmap is not sure of the exact state of the port because nmap after several attempts will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">don&#39;t get response</span><br />There could be some reasons for that, like a firewall filtering the port or an IDS that filter the response.<br /></div>
