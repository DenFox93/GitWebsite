      <h3>Not all bad characters are Bad</h3>
    </strong><br />Sometimes some of the Bad characters are near. This could mean that some BadChar can made adjacent
    byte too a BADCHAR.<br />We should remove one character at time to check which are really Bad Chars.<br />To do that
    follow this guide: <a
      href="https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-bofprep/" target="_blank">https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-bofprep/</a><br />Anyway also if we do
    not find exactly which from these characters are good,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> the final payload
      will work anyway</span>, maybe will be a little more long<br /><br /><br />Start from what we have found in the
    Hexdump <br /> <a href=""><img src="images/2145-1.png" alt="images/2145-1.png" /></a><br />
