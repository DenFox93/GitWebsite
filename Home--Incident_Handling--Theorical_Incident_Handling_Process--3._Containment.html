    <h1 class='title'>3. Containment</h1><br /><strong>Goal of Conatinment</strong><br />The goal of containment is to
    keep the problem from getting worse and stop the bleeding.<br /><br /><strong>Make first a copy of the unaltered
      system</strong><br />As soon as the handler starts to recover the system, there is a point in which the evidence
    starts to become contaminated. If at all possible, the tile system image creation should come before this point so
    there is a copy of the unaltered system.<br /><br /><strong>Containment includes three sub-phases</strong><br />•
    Short-Term Containment → just to stop the damage<br />• Evidence Collection<br />• Long-Term Containment → make sure
    the bad guy is denied access<br /><br /><br /><strong>Survey the Situation</strong><br />Deploy a small on-time
    team(usually the Identification Team) to survey the situation<br />You can also use as reference survey forms at: <a

      the Incident</strong><br />The FIRST organization distributes an incident Case Classification document(<a
      href="https://www.first.org/resources/guides/csirt_case_classification.html" target="_blank">https://www.first.org/resources/guides/csirt_case_classification.html</a>)
    that recommends characterizing an incident based on three areas: <br />• Incident Category:<br /> ◇ Denial of
    Service, Compromised Information, Compromised Asset, Internal Hacking, External Hacking, Malware, Policy
    Violations<br />• Criticality of impacted systems and data (affects response time)<br />• Sensitivity (affects who
    should be notified)<br /><br /><strong>CyberCPR Tool</strong><br />Hardened web application app (locally or with a
    cloud provider) that tracks incidents, systems, and evidence.<br />It supports the incident handler by providing a
    central repository for evidence found and protects legal admissibility by encrypting and hashing (MDS and SHA256)
    all data uploaded. This provides a secure alternative to emailing evidence and updates around the network. <br /> ◇
    Enforces need-to-know on incidents<br /> ◇ All files are hashed and encrypted upon upload<br /> ◇ Tracks user tasks
    and activity<br /> ◇ Tracks attacker campaigns<br /> ◇ Automates key analysis<br /> ◇ Secure real-time OOB
