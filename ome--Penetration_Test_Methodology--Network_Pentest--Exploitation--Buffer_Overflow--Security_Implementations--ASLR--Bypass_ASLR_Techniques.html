    <h1 class='title'>Bypass ASLR Techniques</h1><br />On these sites is possible to find interesting stuff about ASLR
    bypass technique:<br />• <a

      <h3>Non-randomized modules</h3>
    </strong><br />This technique aims to find a module that does not have ASLR enabled and then use a simple JMP/CALL
    ESP from that module<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Bruteforce</h3>
    </strong><br />ASLR can be forced by overwriting the return pointer with plausible addresses until we reach the
    shellcode<br />The success of a brute-force bypass technique depends:<br />• on how tolerant an exploit is to
    variations in the address space layout (e.g.: how many NOPs can be placed in the buffer)<br />• on how many
    exploitation attempts is possible to perform<br />The application <strong>crash</strong> when attempt to guess a
    correct return address fails.<br />This method is typically applied against those services configured to be
    automatically restarted after a crash<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>NOP-Sled</h3>
    </strong><br />We create a big area of NOPs(a lot of NOPs instructions) in order to increase the chances to jump to
    this area.<br />Therefore when will jump on this area of NOPs instructions the execution will “slide” down until we
    reach the shellcode.
