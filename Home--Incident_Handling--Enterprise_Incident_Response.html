    <h1 class='title'>Enterprise Incident Response</h1><br />Determining the systems compromised in an enterprise with
    thousands of machines can seem impossible, but with the right tools and techniques. <br /><br /><strong>Need to
      start somewhere</strong><br />When we are working any incident, the first thing our responders ask for is:<br />•
    Web Proxy: the logs for the egress connections from the firewall<br />• DNS cache or DNS logs<br /> ◇ compare the
    current cache of the DNS server with a list of evil IPs and domains by using a tool like <a
      href="https://bitbucket.org/ethanr/dns-blacklists/src/master/" target="_blank">dns-blacklists</a>.py. <br /> A list to compare
    with is the one from <a href="http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/mdl.php" target="_blank">Malware Domain List</a>.<br />• Connection
    Logs: the logs from whatever external web-filtering device the organization is using<br /> ◇ Because malware not
    always makes persistent connection back to the bad guys’ command and control systems but they can also connect back
    at regular (or irregular) intervals.
