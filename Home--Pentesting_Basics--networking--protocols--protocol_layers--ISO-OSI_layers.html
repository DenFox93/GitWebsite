sequencing of packets.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Network</td><td>Router</td><td>IP addresses, NAT (routing) , OSPF, ICMP, RIP</td><td>how packets of data are routed between end systems over interconnected networks. Routing error detection,and control of node data traffic are managed at this layer</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Data Link</td><td>Switch</td><td>ARP (MAC addresses), SLIP, PPP</td><td>protocols that computers use in order to access the network for transmitting and receiving messages.Has two sub layers:
   → Logical Link Control 
   → Media Access Control</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Physical</td><td>data cables</td><td>HSSI, X.21, EIA/TIA-232, EIA/TIA-449</td><td>defines the physical connection (RJ48, BNC, HSSI, etc…) between a host and a network and converts the bits into voltages or light impulses for transmission</td></tr></table><br /><br />Do remember the ISO/OSI layer we can construct a phrase like that<br />1. <strong>P</strong>lease → Physical<br />2. <strong>D</strong>o → Data Link<br />3. <strong>N</strong>ot → Network<br />4. <strong>T</strong>hrow → Transport<br />5. <strong>S</strong>ausage → Session<br />6. <strong>P</strong>izza → Presentation<br />7. <strong>A</strong>way → Application<br /><br /><strong>Troubleshoot problems:</strong><br />When we need to troubleshoot a problem we need to start from the Layer 1 to the layer 7<br />1 → Is the ethernet cable plug in<br />2 → Check the Green/Gray Light where the ethernet cable is connected to the switch<br />3 → Check the IP address<br />4 → ...<br />....<br /> <br />bibliography: <br />James Summers, “Packet Analysis Reference Guide”, 2008 <br /><br />    <br /></div>
