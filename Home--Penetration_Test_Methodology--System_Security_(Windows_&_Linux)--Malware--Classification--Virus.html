<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Virus</h1><br/>Viruses usually copy themselves to special sections of the hard disk, inside legitimate programs or documents. <br />They run every time an infected program or file is opened.<br />A <strong>virus</strong> spreads from computer to computer, without any direct action or authorization by the owners of the infected machines<br />Viruses do not spread via exploiting vulnerabilities (the ones that do that are called worms)<br /><br />Virus classification:<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Resident Type</span>:<br />    when executed becomes memory resident. It then infects other programs and so on<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Non-Resident type</span>:<br />    when executed, it will search for files it can infect. Then after infecting them, it will quit. When the infected program is run again, it will again find new targets and so on.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Boot-sector virus</span>:<br />    spreads via boot sectors. For example, if a user leaves a infected usb while turning off a system, the next time system will boot-up, the boot sector virus will activate and will thus spread to the hard-disk which will then spread it to another usb. <br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Multi-partite type</span>:<br />    These viruses have several types of infection mechanisms mentioned before</div>
