      <h3>Cloud environments</h3>
    </strong><br />Ask to the client if the target Cloud:<br />• is on a third party provided infrastructure<br /> ◇
    Check the contract to see if the Cloud provider allows or explicitly forbids security assessments or penetration
    tests<br /> ◇ Usually cloud providers explicitly forbid security assessments or penetration tests unless you
    specifically ask for and receive written permission<br /> ◇ Some cloud providers will simply provide the results for
    their most recent assessment to their customers upon request<br />• is a private cloud run only by the
    organization<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Cloud Service Models</h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> → The <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">provider</span> supplies hardware and network connectivity. The <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">tenant(customer)</span> is responsible for the virtual machine and everything
    that runs within it<br /> ◇ Usually Cloud providers allow customers to perform application-level testing (such as
    web application testing) but prohibit them from testing for underlying network and listening service flaws<br />
    <span style="color:#a5452a;">examples</span>: DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Cisco Metapod, Azure VM, Google Compute Engine
    (GCE)<br />• <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> → The <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">provider</span> supplies a framework with all the main components , the <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">tenant(customer)</span> supplies the application they wish to deploy<br /> ◇
    Usually Cloud providers allow customers to perform application-level testing (such as web application testing) but
    prohibit them from testing for underlying network and listening service flaws<br /> <span
      style="color:#a5452a;">examples</span>: Google Colab, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Cloud Services, Heroku,
    Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift<br />• <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> → The
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">provider</span> supplies the application and all the components required to
    run it<br /> ◇ Usually Cloud providers prohibit customers from conducting their own tests, whether at the
    network/service layer or the application layer<br /> <span style="color:#a5452a;">examples</span>: Google Workspace,
    Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting, Azure Websites<br /><br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>
      <h3>The Cloud Stack</h3>
    </strong><br />A cloud solution has different layers. The layers or components that go into building a cloud
    solution are:<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Facility</span> → The actual physical building where
    the cloud solution will be located.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Network</span> → This can be a
    physical or virtual network. It is responsible for carrying communications between systems and possibly the
    Internet.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Compute and Storage</span> → The physical hardware that
    will supply CPU time as well as file storage.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypervisor</span> →
    This is an optional component. When virtualization is used to manage resources, the hypervisor is responsible for
    allocating resources to each virtual machine. It may also be leveraged for implementing security.<br />• <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtual Machine (VM) or Operating System (OS)</span> → In a virtualized
    environment, the VM is the virtual container responsible for running the operating system. If no hypervisor is
    present, the operating system runs directly on the compute and storage hardware.<br />• <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Solution Stack</span> → This is the programming language used to build and
    deploy applications. Good examples are .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.<br />• <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span> → The actual application being used by one or more tenants,
    or their customers.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application Program Interface (API) or Graphical
      User Interface (GUI)</span> → The interface used by the tenant or their customers to interact with the
    application.<br /> The most common API is RESTful HTTP or HTTPS and the most common GUI is an HTTP or HTTPS based
    Web site.<br />When we combine all of these layers, we get a cloud solution. As penetration testers, we need to be
    able to identify which of these layers are in scope for our testing.<br /><br /><a href=""><img
