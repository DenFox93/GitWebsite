<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>3. Project Scope</h1><br/><strong><h3>Project Scope: which are the concerns of the target organization?</h3></strong><br />Usually the <a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--1._Request_for_Proposal_(RFP).html">Request for Proposal(RFP)</a> issued by a client company provides limited details about the penetration test, because of that define clearly the Project Scope is very inportant.<br /><br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Scope</span> and <a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--4._Rules_Of_Engagement_(ROE).html">Rules of Engagement</a>, which come first?<br />    There is not a written rule, whatever target personnel are more comfortable with should come first<br />    Setting first the Project Scope can helps to define Rules of Engagement. <br />    Other times, the Rules of Engagement is already established by the client.<br />    These two phases may be iterative<br /><br /><strong><h3>Scope for the test</h3></strong><br />• What systems to be tested?<br />   ◇ Domain names<br />      ▪ Individual Web Applications<br />   ◇ Network address ranges<br />      ▪ Individual hosts<br />• What systems should be avoided?<br />   ◇ particularly sensitive elements of the organization <br />• If others systems are discovered within the network address ranges or domain names that weren&#39;t considered in the original formulation of the scope, check with the target organization if they have to be tested<br />• Third Parties.<br />   ◇ Get written permission to test the equipment of any third parties<br />      ▪ Internet Service Providers(ISP): routers, switches, mail servers, and DNS servers<br />      ▪ Web Hosting companies: a single web server may house the web presence for a dozen or more customers. Attention!<br />   ◇ The target organization is responsible for getting the written permission<br /><br /><strong><h3>Biggest Security Concerns</h3></strong><br />Ask to the target organization about their biggest security concerns. What worries them? It is better to ask than guess!<br />List(not comprehensive) of Security Concerns and the organizations more impacted about them:<br />   ◇ <strong>Disclosure of sensitive information</strong><br />      ▪ Financial services institutions<br />      ▪ Healthcare companies<br />      ▪ Educational organizations<br />      ▪ ...<br />   ◇<strong> Interruption of production processing</strong><br />      ▪ Manufacturers<br />      ▪ Financial services institutions<br />      ▪ Law firms<br />   ◇ <strong>Embarrassment due to defacement of website</strong><br />      ▪ Advertisers<br />      ▪ Government agencies<br />      ▪ ..<br />   ◇ <strong>Compromising of a machine to use as a jump-off point for deeper penetration(pivoting)</strong><br />      ▪ Every type of organization can be significantly damaged by this issue<br /><br /><strong><h3>Avoid Scope creep</h3></strong><h3> </h3><br />• Discuss threats, risks, and already-known vulnerabilities<br />   ◇ This is a kind of brainstorming session<br />   ◇ Discuss how to best test these areas of concern<br />•  Focus on the area of concern<br />   ◇ Avoid a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Scope creep</span><br />      ▪ With “Scope creep” we meaning the continuous and uncontrolled growth in a project scope. This can happen when the scope of a project is not properly defined.<br />          If a “Scope creep” occur the entire penetration test can begin to be both costly of time and and money<br />   ◇ If focus is difficult because there are many area of concern, suggest to include in the test the low-hanging fruit to start<br /><br /><strong><h3>Denial-of-Service allowed or not</h3></strong><br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Denial-of-Service attack</span> (attacks explicitly designed for denial of service): <br />   ◇ Check only the version number of the target service and check in a list if could be vulnerable to Denial of Service<br />   ◇ Launch the Denial of Service attack against the the target running service. If the service died is vulnerable to Denial of Service BUT this potentially devastating impact on a production environment! Anyway if a service can be crashed by a remote attacker, it may be better to learn about it during controlled circumstances of a penetration test rather than waiting for an hacker to hit it.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Others dangerous exploits:</span><br />   ◇ Some exploits could potentially crash a target service by trying to spawn a shell for the attacker by doing a buffer overflow exploit on the target. <br />        Because such techniques manipulate memory they could render a service inaccessible<br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is always the possibility during a penetration test to crash a service/system</span>:<br />   ◇ Even with no dangerous checks/attacks:<br />      ▪  the tester&#39;s tools will generate some strangely formatted packets that could cause a particularly feeble system to crash. <br />      ▪ Moreover the additional traffic load could push a highly loaded network&#39;s performance over its limit<br />     Because of that there is always a possibility of a crash in a target system. What we have to do is minimize that chance and monitoring services to make sure that they continue to run while a test is underway.<br /><br /><strong><h3>Duration of a Penetration Test</h3></strong><br /> Penetration tests typically last 1 to 3 weeks, followed by reporting interval that could last 1 week or more<br />• Some penetration test are longer; some are shorter<br />• To be efficient is best to have a person conducting manual tests in parallel to automated tools running<br /><br /></div>
