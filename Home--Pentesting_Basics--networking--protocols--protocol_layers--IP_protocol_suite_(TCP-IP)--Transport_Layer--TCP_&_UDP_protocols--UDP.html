<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>UDP</h1><br/>Because there are no Control Bits in UDP, we have far fewer options for scan types. We can&#39;t vary the Control Bits to play with different target behaviors to discern whether ports are open or closed. Because of this, UDP port scans are less reliable and often slower than TCP scans for reasons that we&#39;ll cover shortly<br /><br /><br />UDP → port <strong>open</strong><br /><a href=""><img src="images/635-1.png" alt="images/635-1.png" /></a><br /><br />ICMP port Unreachable → port <strong>closed</strong><br /><a href="file://C:/CherryTree/screenshots2/PTP-elearnsecurity/2.

There are numerous possible reasons for this, including:<br />• The port is closed.<br />• A firewall is blocking the inbound probe packet on its way to the target.<br />• A firewall is blocking the response on its way back to us.<br />• The port is open, but the service listening on the port was looking for a specific payload in the inbound UDP packet. We didn&#39;t include any payload, so it silently ignored us<br /><a href="file://C:/CherryTree/screenshots2/PTP-elearnsecurity/2. Network Security/2.
