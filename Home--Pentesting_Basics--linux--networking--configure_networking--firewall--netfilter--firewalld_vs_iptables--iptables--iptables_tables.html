<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>iptables tables</h1><br/>The netfilter system is based on rules grouped in <strong>tables</strong>, each of these have differents chains. <br />    Each <strong>table</strong> defines a different type of operations that can be performed on packages;<br />    Each chain defines how packets are treated in the different stages of their processing.<br />    <br />TABLES:<br />• <strong>Filter table</strong>: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">default table</span> that  determ if a packet should continue or not<br />• <strong>NAT table</strong>: When data packets move from the private network to the public network, those private IP addresses need to be “translated” into a public IP address that’s compatible with the public network. Same for data packets coming in from public network to private network. <br />    Here comes into play the NAT table that is a table of network address translations, where each row in the table is basically a mapping from one private address to one public address.<br />• <strong>Mangle table</strong>: altere the IP headers of a packet in order to modify TTL(Time To Live), shortening or lengthening the number of valid hops that the packet can sustain, etc...<br />• <strong>Raw table</strong>: packets are inspected with respect to their “state”. (For example, a packet could be part of a new, related or established connection)<br />• <strong>Security table</strong>: The security table is used to set internal SELinux(Security-Enhanced Linux) security context marks on packets.<br />    SELinux defines access controls for applications, processes and files based on security criteria. This is a series of rules that tell SELinux which elements can be accessed or not.</div>
