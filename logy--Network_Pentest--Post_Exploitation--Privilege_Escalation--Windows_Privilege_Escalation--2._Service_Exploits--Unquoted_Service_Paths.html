    <h1 class='title'>Unquoted Service Paths</h1><br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>Unquoted Service Paths</h2>
    </strong><br /><br />• Executables in Windows can be run without using their extension (e.g. “whoami.exe” can be run
    by just typing “whoami”).<br />• Some executables take arguments, separated by spaces, e.g. someprog.exe arg1 arg2
    arg3…<br />• This behavior leads to ambiguity when using absolute paths that are unquoted and contain spaces.<br />
    <span style="color:#a5452a;">example:</span><br /> Consider the following unquoted path: C:\Program Files\Some
    Dir\SomeProgram.exe<br /> ▪ To us, this obviously runs SomeProgram.exe. To Windows, C:\Program could be the
    executable, with two arguments: “Files\Some” and “Dir\ SomeProgram.exe”<br /> ▪ Windows resolves this ambiguity by
    checking each of the possibilities in turn.<br /> ▪ If we can write to a location Windows checks before the actual
    executable, we can trick the service into executing it instead.<br /><br /><strong>When this vulnerability
      arise</strong><br />We need 3 things:<br />1. An executable path of a Windows service is not enclosed within
    quotes(unquoted) and contains one or more spaces in the path<br />2. Write permissions for any of the folders
    containing spaces<br />3. A way to reboot the service or system in order to execute a payload<br /><a href=""><img

        style="color:#ff0000;">Service path is Unquoted</span></strong><br />Windows will search for the service
    executable in the path from left to right, and when a space is reached will append .exe at the end of the first word
    of the folder<br /> <span style="color:#a5452a;">What happen in our example scenario</span><br /> ◇
    C:\Program.exe<br /> ◇ C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ.exe<br /> ◇ C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ Scan
    Utility\SETEVENT.exe<br /><br /><strong>How to exploit this vulnerability</strong><br />We can place our executable
    payload with the name “IJ.exe” file, and when the service starts, it would launch our executable, rather than the
    original “SETEVENT.exe”<br /><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">ATTENTION</span>: We cannot
    place our executable payload with the name &quot;C:\Program.exe&quot; because this file would be in the root
    directory C:\ and to drop any file in the root directory C:\ we should already have Administrator
    privileges<br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• <a
