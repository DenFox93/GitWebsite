It have a summary of its current progress and status for recovery to that point at a later time<br />It is updated every 10 minutes<br />   ◇ press CTRL-C  →  it updates the john.rec file before it exits<br />   ◇ press CTRL-C twice quickly → John terminates without updating john.rec<br /><br /><code>john -restore</code>  → When John is invoked with the --restore option, it checks to see if a john.rec file is present. If it is, John resumes cracking where it left off. It doesn&#39;t waste your time trying guesses that were already done the last time it ran <br /><br />The format of the john.rec file is undocumented, and Solar Designer says that this is on purpose. Who want the details of the john.rec format should just read the source code.<br /><br /></div>
