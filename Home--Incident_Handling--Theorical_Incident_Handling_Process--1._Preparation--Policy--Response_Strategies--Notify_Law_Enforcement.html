<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Notify Law Enforcement</h1><br/><strong><h3>Notify Law Enforcement</h3></strong><br />Whether or not you are required by law to contact a law enforcement agency when an incident occurs depends on the jurisdiction.<br />   ◇ Threat to public health or safety<br />   ◇ Substantial impact on third party<br />   ◇ Legal requirement based on industry (e.g. FDIC, OCC, etc.)<br />  <br /><strong>How interface with Law Enforcement</strong><br />Several things to consider if we decide to contact Law Enforcement. <br />   ◇ There will be two investigations (yours and theirs) with differing goals<br />      ▪ The goals of Law enforcement investigations are usually in support of criminal prosecution<br />      ▪ The goals of Business Investigation is usually focused on getting business back up and running<br />   ◇ A common misconception about working with law enforcement is that they leak details of an incident to the press. They usually don &#39;t go to the media without victim(organization) consent. Especially if it would hinder the investigation, or cause the victim to suffer further damage. Anyway in most jurisdictions law enforcement is not forbidden from contacting the media.<br />   ◇ Law Enforcement might ask to watch attackers, in order to gather more evidence<br />   ◇ Law Enforcement might ask for equipment (computers, hard disks, etc.) that have evidence on them<br />      ▪ though you usually don&#39;t have to provide it, especially if it hurts business operations<br />   ◇ Law Enforcement need access to personnel/people who have technical knowledge and details of the incident</div>
