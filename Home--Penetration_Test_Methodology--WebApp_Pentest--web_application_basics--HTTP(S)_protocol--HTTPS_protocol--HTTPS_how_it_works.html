    initiates the handshake by sending a &quot;hello&quot; message to the server. The message will include which TLS
    version the client supports, the cipher suites supported, and a string of random bytes known as the &quot;client
    random.&quot;<br />2. <strong>The &#39;server hello&#39; message</strong>: In reply to the client hello message, the
    server sends a message containing the server&#39;s <a
      href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/" target="_blank">SSL certificate</a>, the server&#39;s
    chosen cipher suite, and the &quot;server random,&quot; another random string of bytes that&#39;s generated by the
    server.<br />3. <strong>Authentication</strong>: The client verifies the server&#39;s SSL certificate with the
    certificate authority that issued it. This confirms that the server is who it says it is, and that the client is
    interacting with the actual owner of the domain.<br />4. <strong>The premaster secret</strong>: The client sends one
    more random string of bytes, the &quot;premaster secret.&quot; The premaster secret is encrypted with the public key
    and can only be decrypted with the private key by the server. (The client gets the <a
      href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/" target="_blank">public key</a> from the
    server&#39;s SSL certificate.)<br />5. <strong>Private key used</strong>: The server decrypts the premaster
    secret.<br />6. <strong>Session keys created</strong>: Both client and server generate session keys from the client
    random, the server random, and the premaster secret. They should arrive at the same results.<br />7. <strong>Client
      is ready</strong>: The client sends a &quot;finished&quot; message that is encrypted with a session key.<br />8.
    <strong>Server is ready</strong>: The server sends a &quot;finished&quot; message encrypted with a session
    key.<br />9. <strong>Secure symmetric encryption achieved</strong>: The handshake is completed, and communication
    continues using the session keys.<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Cipher Suite</h3>
    </strong><br />A <strong>cipher suite</strong> is a set of algorithms that help secure a network connection. For
    HTTPS it is used to achieve<br /> ◇ confidentiality of data<br /> ◇ integrity of communications<br /> ◇ endpoint
    authentication. <br />For achieving all of these goals is not possible use only one algorithm or cryptosystem.
    <br />The HTTPS client and server must identify a cipher suite that both have in common. Preferable, and by
    convention, the intent is for TLS negotiation to select the most secure cipher suite that is mutually supported by
    client and server.<br /><br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Asymmetric cryptosystems (public/private
      key)</span> → is used for both authentication of endpoints and also securely negotiating a session key that will
    be used with the symmetric cryptosystem for encrypting bulk data in transit. Strictly speaking, the
    asymmetric/public key cryptosystem could be used for confidentiality of data, but asymmetric algorithms are orders
    of magnitude slower than equivalent symmetric algorithms. <br /> ◇ RSA, DH, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA<br />• <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Symmetric cryptosystems (session key)</span> → To securely negotiate/exchange
    the symmetric key(session key) an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Asymmetric cryptosystems</span> is used
    <br /> ◇ DES, TDES/3DES, AES<br />
