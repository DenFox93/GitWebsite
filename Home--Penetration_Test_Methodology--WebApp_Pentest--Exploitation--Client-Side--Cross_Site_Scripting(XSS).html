    <h1 class='title'>Cross Site Scripting(XSS)</h1><br />Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that lets an
    attacker control some of the content of a web application<br /><br /><br />While the web application exhibits the
    flaw, the most obvious and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">likely victim will the end user</span> of the
    Vulnerable Application rather than the Vulnerable Application.<br /> For some orgs, this offers less incentive to
    address these flaws in a timely fashion<br /><br />What an attacker using a XSS can do:<br /> ◇ Modify the content
    of the site at run-time<br /> ◇ Inject malicious content → making the browser&#39;s user load it<br /> ◇ Steal
    session cookies of a user(or of a web site administrator!) → impersonate the user on the vulnerable site <br /> ◇
    Perform actions on the web application as if it was a user → like buy a product or change the password <br /> ◇ View
    any information that the user is able to view.<br /> ◇ Modify any information that the user is able to modify.<br />
    ◇ Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate
    from the initial victim user.<br /><br /><br /><br />XSS vulnerabilities uses unfiltered<strong>
    </strong><strong><span style="color:#ff8700;text-decoration:underline;">parameters coming from the client
        side</span></strong>(we can call them <span style="color:#ff8700;">user input</span>)<strong> </strong>of the
    web application:<br />Request headers, Cookies, Form inputs, POST parameters, GET parameters<br />to control the
    output HTML and JavaScript code<strong> displayed</strong> in the web application client side.<br /><br />All the
    <span style="color:#ff8700;">user input </span>should be validate <strong>server side</strong> by security
    functions. The only way to prevent XSS is never trust of <span style="color:#ff8700;">user
      input</span><br /><br /><strong>Curiosity:</strong><br />Why isn&#39;t XSS called CSS? The CSS acronym was already
    taken (Cascading Style Sheets)<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br />Zseano Methodology: <a
