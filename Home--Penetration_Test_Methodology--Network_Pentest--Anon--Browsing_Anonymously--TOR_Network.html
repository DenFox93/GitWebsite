      Tor differ from Server Proxies</strong><br />• HTTP Proxy Server knows both your IP address and what you browse on
    the Internet<br />• Tor passes your traffic through at least 3 different servers before sending it on to the
    destination<br /> ◇ The first of the three servers can see your IP address and that you are using TOR<br /> ◇ The
    third of the three servers can see in clear the traffic you sent into Tor but it won&#39;t know the IP address that
    sent this traffic<br /> ▪ If you&#39;re using encryption (like HTTPS), it will only know the destination. To
    understand see this funny site (<a
