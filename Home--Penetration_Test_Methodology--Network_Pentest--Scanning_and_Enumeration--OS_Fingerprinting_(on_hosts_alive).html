<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>OS Fingerprinting (on hosts alive)</h1><br/><strong>OS Fingerprinting</strong> refers to any method used to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">determine what OS is running on a host</span>.<br />This is done by analyzing certain protocol flags, options, and data in the packets that a device sends onto the network<br /><br />Knowing the type of the OS, version and the patch level of it we can narrow down the number of potential vulnerabilities that we have to check<br /><br /><strong>Red Teaming</strong><br />OS detection is easy to spot by intrusion detection systems, because a few of the tests use rather unusual packets and packet sequences.Â Sometimes is better skip this phase if we are doing a Red Team Penetration Test.</div>
