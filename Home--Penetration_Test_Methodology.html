    <h1 class='title'>Penetration Test Methodology</h1><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Job of a penetration tester</h3>
    </strong>
    <h3>:</h3><br /> 1) Model the activities of real-world threats to discover vulnerabilities<br /> 2) Through
    controlled exploitation, attempt to determine the business risk associated with these flaws<br /> 3) Recommend
    appropriate defenses<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Defining Terms</h3>
    </strong> <br />• <strong>Threat</strong>:<br /> Someone or something that can cause harm to a target
    organization<br /> Threats include:<br /> ◇ Organized crime, spyware companies, internal employees<br /> ◇ Worms and
    viruses also represent threats because they could cause harm in your organization<br />•
    <strong>Vulnerability</strong>: A flaw someone can exploit to cause harm<br />• <strong>Risk</strong>: Where threat
    and vulnerability overlap. A risk occurs when systems have a vulnerability that a given threat can attack.<br />•
    <strong>Exploit</strong>: Code or technique that a Threat uses to take advantage of a
    vulnerability<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Defining terms(*) associated with what an ethical hacker or penetration tester does on a day-to-day basis</h3>
    </strong><br />*Many people use the following terms interchangeably or without fixed meaning<br />• <strong>Ethical
      hacking</strong>: <br /> Using computer attack techniques to find security vulnerabilities with the permission of
    the target owner and the goal of improving the target&#39;s security<br /> ◇ White Hat hackers are ethical
    hackers<br /> ◇ Black Hat hackers are sinister<br /> ◇ Grey hat has good intentions but does not have
    permission<br />• <strong>Penetration testing</strong>:<br /> Penetration Testing is a subset of ethical
    hacking<br /> While the goal of Ethical Hacking has the goal of discover vulnerabilities;<br /> The goal of
    penetrating is find vulnerabilities in systems, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">penetrating and taking
      control of them</span><br />• <strong>Red Teaming</strong>:<br /> While Penetration testers are often tasked with
    finding as many vulnerabilities a possible<br /> Red Teamers are focused on:<br /> ▪ finding vulnerabilities that
    will help them achieve their goals<br /> ▪ Stealth and Persistence are important aspects<br /> ▪ improve the Blue
    Team&#39;s capabilities to detect the attack and respond to it effectively<br />• <strong>Vulnerability assessments
      (or just security assessments)</strong>:<br /> It is focused on finding vulnerabilities, which may or may not be
    used to get in or steal data<br />• <strong>Security audits</strong>:<br /> Testing against a rigorous set of
    standards. The Audits are almost always done with detailed checklists<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Types of Pen-Tests</h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong>Network services test</strong><br /> Common types of tests, it involves finding vulnerable
    network services and exploit them remotely<br />• <strong>Assumed breach test</strong><br /> Find vulnerabilities in
    the network once an attacker has gained access to a system in the network. <br /> Good way to find issues in.<br />
    ◇ Active Directory permissions<br /> ◇ File permissions<br /> ◇ Client-side software<br />• <strong>Web application
      test</strong><br /> Find vulnerabilities in Web Applications <br />• <strong>Social engineering
      test</strong><br /> Attempt to trick a user into revealing sensitive information<br />• <strong>Wireless security
      test</strong><br /> Find in the target&#39;s physical environment unauthorized wireless access points or
    authorized wireless access points with security weaknesses<br />• <strong>Remote dial-up war dial
      test</strong><br /> Not common type of test today, it involves finding modems in a target environment<br />•
    <strong>Physical security test</strong>: <br /> Find flaws in the physical security practices of a target
    organization.<br />• <strong>Stolen equipment test</strong>: <br /> Obtain a piece of equipment, such as a laptop,
    from the target and then trying to extract sensitive information from it.<br />• <strong>Cryptanalysis
      attack</strong>:<br /> This test focuses on bypassing or breaking the encryption of data stored on a local system
    or across the network.<br />• <strong>Product security test</strong> (aka shrink-wrapped software test):<br /> Find
    vulnerabilities in software products<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>
