    Because it work in the Network layer it can automatically secure applications at the Application layer<br />•
    <strong>TLS/SSL</strong>:<br /> TLS/SSL provide security through implementation into applications, like in
    HTTPS<br />• <strong>SSH</strong>:<br /> It fits in at the top of the model at the application layer. This makes SSH
    an application by nature and work beside other network applications like ftp,http and others. <br /> SSH can be used
    in a port-forwarding mode to create a tunnel for other applications<br /><br />Of course it is possible to tunnel
    traffic through SSH running through TLS on a trusted network using IPsec, but it is not practical since the traffic
    is then encrypted and decrypted three times and uses a huge amount of CPU bandwidth. Selecting one of the
    technologies is normal<br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• <a
