    <h1 class='title'>Covert Channel in TCP and Ip Headers</h1><br />Instead of embed embed one protocol entirely in a
    different protocol, covert channels can also be constructed by inserting data into unused or misused fields of
    protocol headers themselves. <br /><br />The TCP/IP protocol is particularly useful in carrying covert channels,
    because many of the fields in the TCP and IP headers remain unused<br /><br /><a
      href="https://gist.github.com/blurbdust/7cc62a32fcee88849ba7d71af347ec59" target="_blank">Covert_TCP</a><strong> (old
      tool)</strong><br />Covert__TCP offers the ability to carry ASCII data in these fields:<br /> ◇ IP
    Identlfication<br /> ◇ Sequence Number<br /> ◇ Acknowledgment Number<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1671-1.png"

        alt="images/1671-2.png" /></a><br /><br />An attacker can load information into these fields and use it to
    transmit the data across the network using TCP.<br />Of course, other components of the TCP and IP headers (or even
    UDP headers for that matter) could be used to<br />transmit data, such as the reserved, window, code-bits, options,
    or pudding fields, but only these three options are<br />supported by Covert_TCP tool. These options were selected
    by the original creator of the tool because <span style="text-decoration:underline;">they are often left unaltered
      as packets traverse a network</span>.
