        guessing</span></strong> and <strong>password cracking</strong>(meaning <a
      href="ethodology--Network_Pentest--Post_Exploitation--Privilege_Escalation--Windows_Privilege_Escalation--4._Passwords--Dump_&_Crack_the_Hashes.html">Crack
      the Hashes</a>) are often used interchangeably by information security professionals. But these terms do have
    different meanings and profoundly different implications for testers. <br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>PRO &amp;CONS</h3>
    </strong><br />• <strong><span style="color:#ff1b00;">Password guessing</span></strong> involves formulating a guess
    for a password and then trying to use that guess to actually log in to a target system, either locally or across the
    network.<br /> ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">generate a lot of log entries</span> if the system is
    logging failed login attempts, as well as network traffic that an Intrusion Detection System analyst may see<br /> ◇
    It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">could also lock out accounts</span> if the system is configured to
    disable accounts after a threshold of bad login attempts<br /> ◇ It tends to be many orders of magnitude <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">slower than password cracking</span>. The timing of password guessing depends
    on the speed of the target system in processing login attempts, as well as the performance of the network. Some
    target systems even throttle their authentication speeds when a single connection or user tries too many passwords
    in a short time. The speed of password guessing attacks may range from approximately one guess per minute to one
    guess per second<br />• <strong>Password cracking</strong> attack, the attacker gets a copy of the encrypted or
    hashed password representations either from a target machine or by sniffing them off of the network. The attacker
    then cracks the passwords by formulating a guess, encrypting or hashing the guess, and then comparing the result to
    the actual password&#39;s encrypted or hashed value. If the encrypted guess equals the encrypted password, the
    attacker now has a usable password.<br /> ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">happens on the
      attacker&#39;s machines</span>(one or more systems controlled by the attacker), thus <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">stealthier</span>. It generates far less information in logs and in network
    captures (although there may be some records of the theft of the encrypted/hashed passwords, depending on how the
    attacker snags them)<br /> ◇ It <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not lock out accounts</span> because
    the attacker is not using the password guesses to attempt to log in.<br /> ◇ It <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">is faster</span>, can go through huge numbers of guesses quickly. The attacker
    may cycle through tens of thousands to many millions (or more) of guess/encrypt/compare actions every
    second.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>Password Spray(Reverse Brute-Force attack)</h2>
    </strong><br />A type of <span style="color:#ff1b00;">password guessing</span> attack is the <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Password Spray</span> attack where you use a single password with a list of
    users. <br />In Active Directory we can use the script Invoke-Bruteforce.ps1 of the Nishang Framework<br /> <a
      href="https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Scan/Invoke-BruteForce.ps1" target="_blank">https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Scan/Invoke-BruteForce.ps1</a><br />
    <span style="color:#a5452a;">example:</span><br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">
        PS&gt;&nbsp;Invoke-BruteForce&nbsp;-ComputerName&nbsp;targetdomain.com&nbsp;-UserList&nbsp;C:\temp\users.txt&nbsp;-PasswordList&nbsp;C:\temp\pwds.txt&nbsp;-Service&nbsp;ActiveDirectory&nbsp;-StopOnSuccess&nbsp;-Verbose
      </div>
    </div><br /> To make a Password Spray ensure that the password list contains a single password.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>How to use Password Guessing<br /></h2>
    </strong>Given the danger of account lockout, before proceed with Password Guessing test:<strong><br /></strong>1.
    ask the target environment administrators if account lockout functionality is in use.<br /> To be sure ask them to
    run the commands:<br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">
        net&nbsp;accounts/domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#from&nbsp;an&nbsp;account&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;member&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;domain
      </div>
    </div><br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">grep&nbsp;tally&nbsp;/etc/pam.d/*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#on&nbsp;Linux/UNIX</div>
    </div><br />2. To have the confirm about Account Lockout settings, ask to the target organization staff to create
    one or more test accounts for the penetration testing team and provide userIDs and passwords.<br /> Before any
    password guessing attacks are launched, the penetration testing team tries to lock out these accounts by attempting
    100 bad login attempts in a short time, such as over a minute or two(default Lockout observation window is 30
    minutes). <br /> Then, the team tests whether the account has been locked out by trying to use it to log in. <br />
    If the account still works, then in all likelihood the target environment does not have account lockout
    functionality<strong>
