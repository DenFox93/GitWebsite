Start with user&#39;s password<br />2. the user&#39;s password is truncated to be only eight characters long at most<br />3. a bit is removed from each character to turn them into their 7-bit ASCII representations, yielding 56 bits<br />4.  Use resulting 56-bit key to DES encrypt a constant block of 64 bits all set to zero 25 times. This encryption process is repeated 25 times using DES Key+previous Result+Salt<br />   ◇ <span style="color:#ff0000;">Salt is a two-character string, if more are truncated</span> (the 12 bits of the Salt is used to perturb the DES algorithm) chosen from the character set &quot;A-Z&quot;, &quot;a-z&quot;,&quot;0-9&quot;,&quot;.&quot;(period) and &quot;/&quot;.<br />    The Salt is generated in a pseudorandom fashion, is used to perturb the crypto operation, creating an interim result. That interim result is encrypted again using the same password-derived 56-bit DES key, again perturbed by the salt. The encryption process is applied 25 times.<br />    <a href=""><img src="images/725-2.png" alt="images/725-2.png" /></a><br />5.  Results are Base64 encoded and stored as a sequence of 13 ASCII characters(<span style="color:#ff0000;">2 Salt characters</span>+<span style="color:#1e90ff;">11characters of the perturbed Password Hash</span>)<br />•   Some UNIX and Linux variations alter this process by starting with a nonzero block of data to encrypt. Some also vary the number of rounds of encryption applied, going higher than 25</div>
