      Windows</a><br /><br />In this Attack type to capture the Response of the client; we can do that by:<br />•
    <strong>Force the client (target) to start a connection to us (fake server)</strong><br />• Use Man-in-the-Middle
    techniques in order to sniff the client response<br /><br />Remember that NetNTLM(or commonly called NTLM) hashes
    are not NT hashes!<br /><br />While Kerberos is the main authentication protocol in a Windows domain environment,
    NTLMv2 is still widely used and supported in Windows machines. <br />it is still used when the client that is
    authenticating to a server:<br /> ◇ use IP address of the Target insted of a SPN (Service Principals Names) for
    authentication. <br /> Kerberos in fact does not support by default Ip addresses but can be configured to do that(to
    configure follow <a

    implementations, NTLMv2 is rarely fully disabled in corporate environments.<br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• <a
