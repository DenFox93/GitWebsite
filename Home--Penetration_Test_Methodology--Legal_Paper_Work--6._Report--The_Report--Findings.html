    <h1 class='title'>Findings</h1><br /><br />Here the technical results are described. Start with high-risk findings
    and then move to medium and low risk findings<br /><br />For each finding:<br />• <strong>list vulnerable
      system(s)</strong> that exhibit the given flaw<br /> ◇ IP address<br /> ◇ name (if applicable)<br />• <strong>Risk
      level</strong> and how easily the given issue could be exploited: <br /> ◇ High (also called Critical)<br /> ◇
    Medium<br /> ◇ Low (also called Informational)<br />• Explain the <strong>business risk</strong> (two sentence
    summary)<br />• Detailed <strong>technical description</strong><br /> ◇ what the flaw is<br /> ◇ how an attacker
    could exploit it<br /> ◇ impact to the target&#39;s business <br />• <strong>Recommendations</strong><br /> For each
    vulnerability consider: the root cause of the problem, process(es) that allowed the issue to arise, how to prevent
    from happening again<br /> Provide multiple recommendations: give long-term and short-term fixes, higher and lower
    cost alternatives and their benefit, higher and lower operational complexity<br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Applying patches</span>: <br /> vulnerable software usually can be fixed by
    upgrading to a more recent version or applying a patch. <br /> Give also a command line activity from which is
    possible to verify that the patch is in place<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hardening
      systems</span>:<br /> ▪ change the configuration of a target machine to harden it from a security
    perspective<br /> ▪ shut off an unneeded service<br /> ▪ remove software that doesn&#39;t have a defined business
    need<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Applying a filter</span>: <br /> Give also a command line
    activity from which is possible to verify that the filter is properly filtering<br /> Some vulnerabilities can be
    mitigated by applying a filter in front of the target service, through a:<br /> ▪ network firewall<br /> ▪
    network-based Intrusion Prevention System<br /> ▪ host-based filtering technology:<br /> - personal firewall<br /> -
    host-based IPS.<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Altering architecture</span>: <br /> alter the
    overall architecture of the target environment:<br /> ▪ moving systems around<br /> ▪ deploying new kinds of
    technology<br /> ▪ applying filters in a different order<br /> ▪ tweaking the flow of data in the environment<br />•
    <strong>Be careful with including discovered passwords</strong> in the report because these reports are often passed
    around to numerous people in a target organization<br /> ◇ Many penetration testers have a policy of describing the
    characteristics of cracked passwords (such as length or character set) but not including the actual passwords in the
    report<br />• <strong>Screenshots</strong> make the results feel &quot;real&quot; and motivate the organization to
    improve its security stance<br /> ◇ use graphical elements to help focus attention on the most important part<br />•
    <strong>Network diagrams</strong> can be helpful to explain some technical
    ideas<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br />• <a
