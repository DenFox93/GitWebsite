    <h1 class='title'>Vulnerability assessment</h1><br />In this phase we have to do a <strong>list of possible
      vulnerabilities</strong> present on the hosts in scope<br />A penetration tester has to do a <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">vulnerability assessment</span> on each service found<br />Is possible to do
    vulnerability assessment:<br /> • <strong>Automated Scanners</strong> that send queries to a host to find well-known
    vulnerabilities, is important to configure it in order to use the data collected in the previous steps. When the
    scan is complete we will have a report that we can use in the next exploitation phase<br /> ◇
    <strong>Nessus</strong><br /> ◇ OpenVAS<br /> ◇ Nexpose <br /> ◇ GFI LAN Guard.<br /> • <strong>Manual</strong>
    <strong>Testing</strong> when automated scanners are not enough we have to use data collected in the previous step.
    Testing a custom application is very similar to testing a web application that means:<br /> ◇ Learning and
    understanding its features<br /> ◇ Understanding how it exchanges data over the network<br /> ◇ Understanding how it
    accesses resources like databases, servers, local and remote files and so on<br /> ◇ Reverse engineering its
    logic<br /> • <strong>both</strong>(manually and with automated scanner)<br /><br /><span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Information Gathering</span> and <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Scanning</span> phases are needed to <strong>“widening the attack
      surface”</strong>, <br />hackers use these two phases also to launch targeted attacks that do not trigger alarms
    in the victim&#39;s defense system<br /><br /><br /><strong>

      <h3> a Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
    </strong><br />Vulnerability Assessment is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">simply a scan</span> of the
    vulnerabilities found on networks and applications. There is NOT exploitation phase<br /><a

    the infrastructure<br /><strong>CONS:</strong><br />• is <strong>more in shallower</strong>, both in terms of
    vulnerabilities tested and vulnerabilities discovered(because of the absence of the cyclic process)<br /> ◇ we
    don&#39;t proceed with the exploitation phase, so we <span style="text-decoration:underline;">can not confirm the
      vulnerabilities</span> by testing them and giving proof of their existence<br /> ◇ we can&#39;t cycle after the
    exploitation phase, and so we <span style="text-decoration:underline;">can not discover others vulnerabilities
      increasing privileges on the target hosts and/or network </span><br /> <br /><strong>
      <h3>Vulnerability Research Sources</h3>
    </strong><br />These sites publish information about vulnerabilities discovered in System or Services. <br />Even
    though an exploit might not be available, the tester still needs to understand the vulnerabilities so that they can
    be included in the test report<br />• The <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts" target="_blank">National Cyber Awareness
      System</a>, maintained by the US Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
    (CISA)<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/147-2.png" alt="images/147-2.png" /></a><br />• The <a
      href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html" target="_blank">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository</a>
    operated by Mitre<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/147-3.png" alt="images/147-3.png" /></a><br />• The <a
      href="https://hackerstorm.info/nvd/nvd.php" target="_blank">HackerStorm website</a>, which includes a free, downloadable Open
    Source Vulnerability Database tool that can be stored locally by a tester for searching even without internet
    access<br /> <a href=""><img src="images/147-4.png" alt="images/147-4.png" /></a>
