    into notebooks are not the ideal solution<br /> Integrated WNIC (Wireless Network Interface Controller) that enables
    Wi-Fi communications in the notebook chassis are not the ideal solution for penetration testers as they can not
    provide the necessary signal power and receiving sensitivity, crucial parameters for a successful wireless
    attack.<br /><br />• external USB Wi-Fi dongle are better<br /> A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">better
      option is to buy an external USB Wi-Fi dongle</span>. This is especially true if you plan to perform your attacks
    from a virtualized environment as an integrated wireless card will simply work as an Ethernet card in your guest
    OS<br /> What to look when we buying a new Wi-Fi adapter<br /> ▪ Signal power<br /> ▪ Receiver sensitivity<br /> ▪

    AWUS036ACH (a/b/g/n/ac) is the best performing card, but the driver can be unstable enough to crash your
    kernel<br /> ◇ Alfa AWUS036ACM (a/b/g/n/ac) is the highest performing of the STABLE devices, but it requires kernel
    4.19.5 or higher<br /> Above are the wireless card recommended while i am writing this blog: 10/08/2021
    <br /><br /><strong>Antenna of Wi-Fi adapters (APs)</strong><br />external USB Wi-Fi dongle with integrated antenna
    are not the best choice when it comes to penetration testing. We need a flexible adapter that gives us the ability
    to change the attached antenna to fit your scenario.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Power Gain
      (dB/dBi/dBd)</span>:<br /> Power Gain is the connection range of a Wi-Fi adapter and is specified using <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">decibels</span>(dB):<br /> ◇ dBi<br /> ◇ dBd (1 dBd = 2.14dBi)<br /> ◇ dBm
    (measured in mW not dB) → measures the power the antenna is emitting, which can play a significant role in how much
    range the router has<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Types of antennas</span>:<br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Omnidirectional</span><br /> They are designed to pick up signals coming from
    multiple directions , typically in a 360° area. Because of that, they are commonly found on all wireless enabled
    consumer devices. <br /> Power Gain ranges from 2 dBi to 9 dBi. But because power spreads in each direction, their
    power gain is inherently lower than directional antennas which focus their energy across a narrow angle.<br /> ◇
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Directional</span><br /> They their power gain is inherently higher than
    omnidirectional antennas, because focus their energy across a narrow angle.<br /> Power Gain of these antennas can
    be easily over 12 dBi <br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br />• <a
