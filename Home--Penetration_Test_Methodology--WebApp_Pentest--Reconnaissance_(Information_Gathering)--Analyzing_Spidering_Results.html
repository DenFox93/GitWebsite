<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Analyzing Spidering Results</h1><br/><a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Reconnaissance_(Information_Gathering)--Spidering_(aka_Crawling).html">After we have spidered a site</a>, we analyze the results to look for various items, including:<br />• <strong>HTML Comments</strong> that reveal useful or sensitive information<br />    Web applications commonly contain comments in the HTML they send to the browser<br />    Such comments are included in the server response and visible by the client(while should be moved to server-side comment)s:<br />   ◇ Developer notes can reveal significant issues: <br />        &quot;&lt;!-- Don&#39;t forget to fix the auth bug --&gt;&quot;<br />   ◇ Explanations of functionality:<br />        &quot;//This function passes input to the query&quot;<br />   ◇ Explanations of variables:<br />        &quot;/* Variable for user auth level… don&#39;t change! */&quot;<br />   ◇ Usernames and passwords:<br />        &quot;&lt;!-- The db user/pass is scott/tiger --&gt;&quot;<br /><br />• <strong>Disabled functionality</strong><br />    As web applications evolve, some developers leave behind disabled functionality. These Disabled functionality often reveals previous or future sections of the site<br />    These need to be tested and reported on<br />    Although officially &quot;disabled,&quot; sometimes such functionality can be invoked<br />    It may contain significant security weaknesses, as it often gets less attention than other components of a site or application<br />    Even though &quot;disabled&quot; such functionality could lead to undermining the entire application<br />   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Types of Disabled Functionality</span><br />   ◇ Links that have been commented out<br />      ▪ These links could link to older, future, or privileged pages<br />      ▪ Most of the spidering tools list comments found Client-side code that has been commented out<br />   ◇ Client-side code that has been commented out<br />      ▪ code that is no longer used<br />        This code may point at either functions or areas of the site that are no longer used. These sections of the site may be a weakness that can be exploited        <br />      ▪ Functionality that was replaced by server-side code<br />        By being able to see the client-side version, the attacker may be able to identify weaknesses in the code.<br /><br />• <strong>Linked servers</strong><br />   ◇ Such as content and application servers</div>
