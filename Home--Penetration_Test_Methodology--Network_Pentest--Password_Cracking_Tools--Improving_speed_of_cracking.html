      <h2>Improve the speed of cracking</h2>
    </strong><br />• divide the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">work across multiple machines</span> by
    splitting up the wordlist (bad guys use botnets to do that)<br />• use of commercial <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">cloud resource</span>s like:<br /> ◇ <strong>Amazon EC2</strong>. The prices
    below are for Linux instances; Windows machines cost slightly more due to the commercial software license of the
    operating system<br /> ▪ CPU instances with 1 compute unit (equivalent of 1 GHz CPU) for approximately USD0.10 per
    hour<br /> ▪ GPU instances with 33 compute units (equivalent of 2 NVIDIA GPUs) for approximately USD2.00 per
    hour<br /> ◇ <strong>NPK</strong> (<a
      href="https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/npk" target="_blank">https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/npk</a>) is a distributed
    hash-cracking platform built entirely of serverless components in AWS including Cognito, DynamoDB, and S3. It is a
    cost-effective way to crack, It is fast. <br /> ▪ It is possible to crack at a speed of 1.2TH/s [1200000MH/s] of
    NTLM (equivalent of 40 NVIDIA GPUs) for USD14.70 per hour.<br />
