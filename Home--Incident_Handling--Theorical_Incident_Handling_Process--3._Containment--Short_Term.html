    <h1 class='title'>Short Term</h1><br /><br />• Try to prevent the attacker from causing more damage, while:<br /> ◇
    Minimizing the changes to data on the system(s)<br /> ◇ Get untainted evidence through image creation process<br />•
    Possible short-term containment actions<br /> ◇ Disconnect network cable<br /> ◇ Pull the power cable: Loses
    volatile memory and may damage drive<br /> ◇ Apply filters to routers and/ or firewalls<br /> ◇ Change a name in DNS
    to point to a different IP address. This because most attackers target systems based on their IP address (such as
    198.167.21.14) and not their domain name (www.[yourdomainname].com). <br />• We could use ADHD<br /> With Active
    Defense Harbinger Distribution we can deploy honeypots that waste an attacker’s time, alert the administrator of the
    attack while still harmless and gathers information on the sources of the attack.<br /> An useful tool included in
    ADHD is “Web Bug Server” for tracking when a document is opened<br /> ◇ project page: <a

      coordination</strong><br />For external attacks, coordinate with your internet service provider<br />It may be
    able to assist you in identification, containment, and recovery. Especially for large packet floods, bot-nets,
    worms, and virulent spam<br /><br /><br /><strong>Creating Forensics Images</strong><br />Failure to make a good
    working forensics image is one of the most common errors<br />Make forensics images of affected system(s) as soon as
    is practical<br />• Grab an image of memory as well as the file system<br />• Don’t do graceful shutdown, you will
    lose valuable data!<br />• Use blank media<br /> ◇ Old media often contain remnants<br /> ◇ New purchased media may
    have some data on it, so beware<br />• If possible, make a bit-by-bit image to get all file system data<br />• Not
    all incidents will allow you to do a full backup and analysis<br />• Tools:<br /> ◇ dd → Create binary images on
    UNIX and Windows machines<br /> ▪ UNIX: It is built into many UNIX and Linux distributions<br /> ▪ WINSOWS:
    available in many incarnations for free for Windows<br /> ◇ Rekall → Tool by Google for capturing and analyzing
    memory on Windows machines (<a href="https://github.com/google/rekall" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/rekall</a>, <a
