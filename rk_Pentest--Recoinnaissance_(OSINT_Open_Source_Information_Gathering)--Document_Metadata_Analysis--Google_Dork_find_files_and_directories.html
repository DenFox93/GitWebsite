    application can use Google&#39;s advanced query commands, also known as <strong>Google Dorks</strong><br />

    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">intitle:&quot;index&nbsp;of&quot;&nbsp;passwd&nbsp;site:example.com</div>
    </div><br /> look for directories that have a file in them called passwd.<br /> Note that a number of the passwd
    files in interesting domains discoverable by Google searches are either honeypot /etc/passwd files or sites that may
    try to exploit a browser surfing there! So be careful when doing this kind of search, unless you restrict it using
    the &quot;site:&quot; directive to domains that are more trustworthy<br />
    <div class="codebox">
      <div class="codebox">inurl:viewtopic.php&nbsp;site:example.com</div>
    </div><br /> Finds sites with URLs that contain &quot;viewtopic.php&quot; in them. That script is commonly
    associated with the phpBB suite of tools for implementing web-based discussion forums. Historically, there have been
    numerous flaws in phpBB implementations, so locating those sites is helpful if a new vulnerability is
    discovered<br /><br /><strong>
