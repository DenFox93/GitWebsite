<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>IAT hooking</h1><br/><strong>IAT (Import Address Table) Hooking</strong>:<br />    Windows executables do not contain the entire code that would allow them to execute as a process independently. Instead, to reduce the size of executables and improve performance, code that is commonly used is shared among different processes using DLL files. During compilation, a stub code is generated for all the API calls that are imported from the shared DLL files. These stub functions are located in a section of the process code identified as the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">import address table (IAT)</span>. <br /><br />    Technique applied by modifying the IAT table of the executable by replacing the address of the hooked function with a pointer to the rootkit code ;<br />    <a href=""><img src="images/572-1.png" alt="images/572-1.png" /></a></div>
