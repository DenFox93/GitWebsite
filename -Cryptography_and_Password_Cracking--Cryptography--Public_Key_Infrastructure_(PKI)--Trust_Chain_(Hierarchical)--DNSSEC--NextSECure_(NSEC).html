    <h1 class='title'>NextSECure (NSEC)</h1><br /><br />Unlike standard DNS, where the server returns an unsigned
    NXDOMAIN (Non-Existent Domain) response when a subdomain does not exist, DNSSEC guarantees that every answer is
    signed. This is done with a special record that serves as a proof of non-existence called the NextSECure (NSEC)
    record. An NSEC record can be used to say: “there are no subdomains between subdomains X and subdomain Y.” By
    filling the gap between every domain in the zone, NSEC provides a way to answer any query with a static record. The
    NSEC record also lists what Resource Record types exist at each name.<br /><br />For statically signed zones, there
    are, by definition, a fixed number of records. Since each NSEC record points to the next, this results in a finite
    ‘ring’ of NSEC records that covers all the subdomains. Anyone can ‘walk’ a zone by following one NSEC record to the
    next until they know all subdomains. This method can be used to reveal all of the names in that zone---possibly
    exposing internal information.<br /><br /><br />
