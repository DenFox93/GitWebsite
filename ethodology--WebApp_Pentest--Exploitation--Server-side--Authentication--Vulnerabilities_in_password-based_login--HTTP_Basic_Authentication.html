    <h1 class='title'>HTTP Basic Authentication</h1><br /><br /><br />Old and very simply to implement <br />In HTTP
    basic authentication, the client receives an authentication token from the server, which is constructed by
    concatenating the username and password, and encoding it in Base64. This token is stored and managed by the browser,
    which automatically adds it to the Authorization header of every subsequent request as
    follows:<br /><br /><code>Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)</code><br /><a href=""><img
        src="images/2083-1.png" alt="images/2083-1.png" /></a><br /><br />For a number of reasons, this is generally not
    considered a secure authentication method. Firstly, it involves repeatedly sending the user&#39;s login credentials
    with every request. Unless the website also implements HSTS, user credentials are open to being captured in a
    man-in-the-middle attack.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
