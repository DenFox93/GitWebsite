    injection is a type of injection issue that occurs when a user is able to control an input point and is able to
    inject arbitrary HTML code into a vulnerable web page. This vulnerability can have many consequences, like
    disclosure of a userâ€™s session cookies that could be used to impersonate the victim, or, more generally, it can
    allow the attacker to modify the page content seen by the victims<br /><br />HTML Injection is very closely related
    to XSS. <br />The HTML Injection flaw allows for the attacker to inject HTML code into the server&#39;s response to
    a victim, this code then will be rendered by the victim browser
