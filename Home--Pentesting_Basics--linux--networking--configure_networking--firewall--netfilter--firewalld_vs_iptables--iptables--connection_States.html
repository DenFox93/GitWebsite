<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>connection States</h1><br/><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Connection tracking</span> allows iptables to make decisions about packets viewed in the context of an ongoing connection.<br /><br />Connections tracked by the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">connection tracking system</span> will be in one of the following <strong>states</strong>:<br />• NEW: new packet s that is not associated with an existing connection  <br />• ESTABLISHED: A connection is changed from NEW to ESTABLISHED when it receives a valid response in the opposite direction. For TCP connections, this means a SYN/ACK and for UDP and ICMP.<br />• RELATED: packets associated with a connection already in the system(example: FTP data connection) are labeled RELATED. <br />• INVALID: Packets not associated with any existing connection or suitable for a new connection that cannot be identified and/or if they are unroutable.<br />• UNTRACKED: Packets that have been marked with the NOTRACK target in one of the raw chains will bypass the connection tracking routines.<br />• SNAT: source modified by NAT.<br />• DNAT: destination modified by NAT.<br /><br /></div>
