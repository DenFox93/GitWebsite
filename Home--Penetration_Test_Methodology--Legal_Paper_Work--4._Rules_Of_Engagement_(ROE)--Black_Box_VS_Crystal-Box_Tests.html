<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Black Box VS Crystal-Box Tests</h1><br/><strong>Why do a Black Box Testing</strong><br />   ◇ More like the real-world attackers? This is not necessarily true. A real-world attacker might have a picture of your network architecture,stolen for example from an employee. <br />   ◇ I a network diagram have significant limitations or errors, it may bias penetration testers that can miss details and sometimes overlooking hosts or whole networks<br /><br /><strong>Why do a Crystal Box Testing</strong>(usually recomendeed than Black Box Testing)<br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more cost effective</span> because the attackers can quickly perform their reconnaissance and scanning<br />   ◇ have a network diagram lets the penetration testing team analyze a worst-case scenario, where the attacker have it<br />   ◇ lowered chance of an error that can cause damage to an out-of-scope system<br /><br /><strong><span style="color:#1e90ff;">Hybrid Testing</span></strong>(best)<br />The testing team starts out with a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Box Testing</span> with nothing more than a domain name and performs detailed recon and scanning. <br />Then after a week or so, we can start a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Crystal Box Testing</span> and the target organization provides a detailed diagram of the network for further testing and analysis.<br />CONS:<br />   ◇ Hybrid tests usually take a little longer and therefore cost more</div>
