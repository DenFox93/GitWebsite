<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Birthday Attack</h1><br/><br />The birthday attack is an attack used to attempt discover collisions in hashing algorithms(functions), such as MD5 or SHA1.<br /><br /><strong><h3>Explanation of the birthday problem in probability theory</h3></strong><br />The name is based on the &quot;Birthday Paradox&quot; that states that in a room with 23 people or more, the odds (this can be counterintuitive) are greater than 50% that two will share the same birthday.<br />We are not trying to match a specific birthday (such as your’s); we are trying to match any birthday.<br /><br />If you are in a room full of 23 people, you have a 1 in 365 chance of sharing a birthday with each of the 22 other people in the room, for a total of 22/365 chances. If you fail to match, you leave the room and Joe has a 21/365 chance of sharing a birthday with the remaining people. If Joe fails to match, he leaves the room and Morgan has a 20/365 chance, and so on. If you add 22/365 + 21/365 + 20/365 + 19/365 … + 1/365=253, you pass 50% probability.<br /><br /></div>
