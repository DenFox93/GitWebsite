    <h1 class='title'>4. Rules Of Engagement (ROE)</h1><br /><strong>
      <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
    </strong><br />If we don&#39;t nail down written Rules of Engagement in advance, we could run into significant
    trouble and the penetration test will be seen as less valuable.<br />• <a
      href="file://C:/CherryTree/screenshots2/PTP-elearnsecurity/0. Planning/Rules_of_Engagement_Worksheet.rtf">HERE</a>
    we have an example of how can be formatted such document<br /><br />• <strong>incident handling
      procedure</strong><br />We also need a contact(client&#39;s employee or manager) with which we can communicate if
    an <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--4._Rules_Of_Engagement_(ROE)--Announced_VS_Unannounced_Tests.html">incident</a>
    occurs.<br /> When we conduct a penetration test, incidents(unwanted situation that affect client&#39;s environment)
    can happen especially when we don&#39;t have a lot of knowledge about the tested environment. If we plan to do risky
    test we have to communicate it to the client, so that these can be done in preferred hours where a service stoppage
    is less painful.<br /> We have always have an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">incident handling
      procedure</span> ready:<br /> simplest way is to have the contact of a person on the client&#39;s side that is
    available to coordinate the incident handling. <br /> <br />

    </div><br /><br />• <strong>Encrypted Communications</strong>: agree upon a secured method of communication
    regarding vulnerability details and the final report. We can use:<br /> ▪ encrypted email<br /> ▪ security content
    management technology (e.g: <a href="https://www.box.com/en-gb/cloud-content-management" target="_blank">Box</a>)<br /> ▪ PGP/GPG,
    due to the additional technical requirements and the waning usage, it is not very used these days.<br /> ▪ NO ZIP
    files, are less secure because the shared password used to protect the symmetric key in the ZIP file could come
    under attack. A bad guy could steal the shared password, or it could leak if it is shared among too many
    people.<br /> <br />• <strong>daily debriefing conference call</strong><br /> At the beginning or end of each
    testing dayor most commonly once or twice a week, schedule a brief session(15-30 minutes long) between the testing
    team and one or two representatives of the target organization. These calls help to make sure that everyone
    understands the progress of the test and to identify any issues early on.<br /> During the debriefing, the team
    should discuss what the team has done so far and what they plan to do next<br /><br />• <strong>Remain in the
      scope</strong><br /> we make sure that the target of the engagement is property of our client<br /> If the
    target&#39;s client use a shared hosting service(type of web hosting where a single physical server hosts multiple
    sites), in that case we can&#39;t conduct an assessment on that target, unless the hosting provider give us a
    written permission<br /><br />• <strong>Dates and Time of Day</strong><br /> Agree upon an explicit start date and a
    finish date and upon acceptable times for testing. if testing are required during off-hours or weekends additional
    charge incur (up to 25%)<br /><br />• <strong>Automated Shunning functionality by IDS/firewall</strong><br /> I the
    Rules of Engagement must explicitly take into account any automated shunning functionality the target organization
    may have. This mean that if IDS or IPS spots an attack, it could reconfigure a firewall to automagically block
    it.<br /> If Auto shunning is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">too widely applied</span> could turn
    inadvertently a penetration test into a denial-of-service attack. Or narrowly focused blocking would just render
    much of the test useless. <br /> To avoid these conditions, you should do one of the following, and document it in
    the Rules of Engagement:<br /> ◇ Have target organization personnel disengage shunning functionality.<br /> ◇
    Include an exception for the source addresses of the testing organization.<br /> ◇ <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--4._Rules_Of_Engagement_(ROE)--Announced_VS_Unannounced_Tests.html">Announce
      the test</a> and get an alert when shunning starts so that it can be manually deactivated, allowing traffic from
    testers through.<br /><br />• <strong>Viewing data on the target</strong><br /> ◇ If the penetration tester
    successfully penetrates a target, should they avoid viewing data on the target?<br /> ▪ By default our Rules of
    Engagement allow the testers to view configuration data from a machine but to avoid looking at any customer and user
    data on the machine.<br /> ▪ With the written permission of the client, in some tests, it may be appropriate to
    sample small amounts of sensitive user data to confirm access and assess the business impact.<br /> - focus more on
    counting the number of sensitive records that is possible to access than on retrieving them<br /> ◇ If Sniffers are
    used, explicit that if any personal data are captured from the network will be ignored by the penetration testing
    team <br /><br />• <strong>What the Rules of Engagement does </strong><strong><span
        style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span></strong><strong> include</strong><br /> ◇ price of
    the test service<br /> ◇ Limitations of Liability: this is better handled in the Contractual Agreement<br /> ◇
    Intellectual property Ownership: also this is better handled in the Contractual Agreement and explain to who belong
    the resulting report and the methodology behind it:<br /> ▪ target organization<br /> ▪ penetration tester<br /> ▪
    both<br /> ◇ Permission to conduct the test: also this is better handled in the <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Legal_Paper_Work--5._Contractual_Agreements.html">Contractual
      Agreement</a>
