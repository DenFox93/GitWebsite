<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Objects</h1><br/><br />• Objects are essentially a representation of data that is provided as a result of running a cmdlet.<br />• Rather than with other scripting languages where data is output as text most of the time, PowerShell is different in that the data being output originates from classes within the .NET Framework in the form of “objects.”<br /> <br /></div>
