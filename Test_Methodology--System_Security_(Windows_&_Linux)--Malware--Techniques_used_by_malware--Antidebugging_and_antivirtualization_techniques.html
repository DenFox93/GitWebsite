      <h2>Antidebugging and Antivirtualization techniques</h2>
    </strong><br />When security researchers wish to understand how a piece of malicious code works, they often execute
    that code using a debugger, so that they can examine the behavior step-by-step.<br />Also, researchers typically
    emulate malware samples inside a virtual machine so that any damage caused by the software is limited to the
    virtualized environment.<br /> <br />Some malware authors know that and include features that allow the malware to
    detect when it is being run in either a debugger or a virtual machine. If such an environment is detected, the
    malware behaves differently. By doing so, the malware becomes much more difficult to analyze and, therefore,
    counteract.<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Anti-Virus easy to bypass</h3>
    </strong><br />Anti-Virus and malware detectors are based on signature matching (how we can see clearly on <a
      href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank">https://www.virustotal.com</a>), thus they are based on purely matching of
    syntactic information between codes and can be fooled by such obfuscation technique.<br />
