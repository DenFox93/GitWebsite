    testers also performs scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities in hopes of

    ◇ Ensure Rules of Engagement(ROE) is signed by client. <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Verify_the_Scope.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Add IPs in scope to Scope tab in our excel. Like this one <a
      href="file://C:/CherryTree/Files/External Pentest/TCMS - External Pentest Checklist.xlsx">HERE</a><br /> ◇ Verify
    customer scope. <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Verify_the_Scope.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Send kickoff email. <br /> ▪ Start and End of the Penetration Test<br /> ▪ Critical Vulnerabilities found that
    should be immediately addressed. <br /> ▪ If these critical vulnerabilities are been found in a Web App or anyway in
    one of the system in the perimeter directly connected to the Internet.<br /> ▪ Point out to the organization that
    the vulnerability could have been already exploited already by an Hacker.<br /> ◇ Conduct vulnerability scanning
    with Nessus. <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Vulnerability_assessment--Automated_Scanners.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Identify e-mails/users/pass in breach databases (Dehashed, breach-parse, etc.). <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Credential_Stuffing.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Identify employees &amp; email address format (LinkedIn, phonebook.cz, clearbit, hunter.io, etc.) <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Credential_Stuffing.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Identify client&#39;s website(s) and search for any data useful to help attack (job posting, system information,
    password policy, etc.) <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Websites_OSINT.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Attempt to enumerate any accounts on portals, password reset functions, etc. <a
      href="_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Credential_Stuffing--Enumerating_valid_accounts.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Run web app scans, if necessary <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Vulnerability_assessment--Automated_Scanners.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Conduct manual testing and exploitation on targets <a
      href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Exploitation.html">HERE</a><br /> ▪ Validate scanning
    tool vulnerabilities <br /> ◇ Conduct password spraying guessing and brute force on login portals <a
      href="_Methodology--Network_Pentest--Recoinnaissance_(OSINT_Open_Source_Information_Gathering)--Credential_Stuffing--Enumerating_valid_accounts.html">HERE</a><br />
    ◇ Escalate access from external to internal with the information discovered before<br /> ▪ if we had access to an
    email account search for VPN emails information <br /> ▪ if we had access to an Azure Active Directory Portal we can
    dump the accounts that are being part of, then try password spraying attack (if allowed)<br /> ▪ ... <br /> ◇
    Validate previous year findings have been resolved<br /> ◇
