    <h1 class='title'>Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication</h1><br /><br />Many websites rely exclusively on
    single-factor authentication using a password to authenticate users. However, some require users to prove their
    identity using multiple authentication factors.<br /><br />it is increasingly common to see both mandatory and
    optional two-factor authentication (2FA) based on something you know and something you have. This usually requires
    users to enter both a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">traditional password</span> and a <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">temporary verification code from an out-of-band physical device</span> in their
    possession.<br /><br />Two-factor authentication is more secure than single-factor authentication. However, as with
    any security measure, it is only ever as secure as its implementation. <br /><br />It is also worth noting that the
    full benefits of multi-factor authentication are only achieved by verifying multiple different factors. Verifying
    the same factor in two different ways is not true two-factor authentication. Email-based 2FA is one such example.
    Although the user has to provide a password and a verification code, accessing the code only relies on them knowing
    the login credentials for their email account. Therefore, the knowledge authentication factor is simply being
    verified twice<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Two-factor authentication tokens</h3>
    </strong><br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Good</span>: Verification codes are usually read by the
    user from a physical device of some kind. It is also common for websites to use a dedicated mobile app, such as
    Google Authenticator.<br /><br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bad</span>: Some websites send
    verification codes to a user&#39;s mobile phone as a text message. <br /> While this is technically still verifying
    the factor of &quot;something you have&quot;, it is open to abuse. <br /> ◇ Code is being transmitted via SMS rather
    than being generated by the device itself. This creates the potential for the code to be intercepted. <br /> ◇ Risk
    of SIM swapping, whereby an attacker fraudulently obtains a SIM card with the victim&#39;s phone number. The
    attacker would then receive all SMS messages sent to the victim, including the one containing their verification
    code.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br /><a
