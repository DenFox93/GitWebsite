<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Passive Sniffing</h1><br/><strong>Passive sniffing</strong> attacks are performed by just “watching” packets on a network in order to gather sensitive information such as userids, passwords, and other sensitive information.<br />They are difficult to be detected due to their “hands off” approach to gathering information.<br />The only tool you need is a sniffer, such as Wireshark</div>
