    <h1 class='title'>API Attacks</h1><br /><br /><strong>JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks</strong><br />A problem with
    AJAX is the complexity of the application. Commonly, developers include multiple functions in a single JavaScript
    file. Although this can and does happen in &quot;normal&quot; applications, it is wider spread in AJAX applications.
    <br /><br /><strong>Framework Files</strong><br />Framework files are available for testers to download and look for
    functions that the application isn&#39;t using on this particular page and call them directly. This is similar to
    the logic attack, except it uses functionality that shouldn&#39;t have been exposed. <br /><span
      style="color:#a5452a;">example</span>: the developer could includes functions used by admin pages in the .js
    files. We cannot access the actual admin pages, but we can call the JavaScript functions directly. For example add
    users to the system and then logged in as them.<br /><br /><strong>Third-Party Frameworks</strong><br />Often during
    testing we can find libraries from third-party sites(jQuery, MooTools,...).<br />These libraries provide many
    different functions and are so common because they provide developers with prebuilt capabilities from aesthetics to
    business functionality<br />During mapping phase, the attacker should find these libraries and identify them either
    from comments or titles within the files. By identifying these libraries, we can find out many things about the
    application. <br /> ◇ libraries have specific uses, so we can know some of the purposes of the site based on the
    libraries<br /> ◇ libraries may bring their own weaknesses to the application.<br /><br /><strong>Discovering
      Frameworks</strong><br />Most of the API files should be found during spidering.<br />Look for <a
      href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp" target="_blank">src</a><a
      href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp" target="_blank"> attribute</a> that specifies the URL of an external
    JavaScript file.<br />Looking through the application map, we should see <strong>.js</strong> files that are loaded
    by the various pages.<br />We just need to examine the code and look for interesting functions: <br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">XMLHttpRequest calls</span><br /> ◇ functions that load data from elsewhere
    <br /> ◇ functions that reference &quot;sensitive&quot; functionality (such as administrative
    actions)<br /><br /><strong>Exploiting Framework Flaws</strong><br />API exploitation is a manual process<br /> ◇ We
    may call functions without authentication, re-creating what the code would have done<br /> ◇ We may gather
    information for further exploits<br /> ◇ Use some known-flaw exploitation of complex code that has not been updated
