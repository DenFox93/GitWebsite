<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Social Engineering (not always allowed)</h1><br/>The goal of Social Engineering is to exploit the human factor.<br />In other words, putting people in situations where they will rely on the most common forms of social interactions:<br />   ◇ The desire to be helpful<br />   ◇ The tendency to trust people<br />   ◇ The fear of getting in trouble<br />   ◇ Conflict avoidance<br /><br />Types of Social Engineering:<br />• <strong>Pretexting</strong>:<br />     It is the art of placing a person in a realistic but fake situation, in order to divulge the necessary information or, perform the necessary action(s)<br />• <strong>Phishing</strong>:<br />     It is an attack that utilizes a fraudulent email crafted in a way to make it appear as if it is from a legitimate company, in order to divulge the necessary information or, perform the necessary action(s).<br />    Phishing attacks differ according to the target:<br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whaling</span>: targets Executives in an organization, such as the CEO for gaining specific types of information<br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Spear Phishing</span>: targets individuals within an organization<br />• <strong>Baiting</strong>:<br />    It takes advantage of one of the most basic traits of humanity, “Curiosity”<br />    <span style="color:#a5452a;">example:</span><br />    Leave media such as a CD, DVD or USB Stick in a location of passage, relying on the curiosity factor of a passerby to pick up the media and take a look at its contents<br />• <strong>Physical</strong>:<br />    When a penetration tester try to gain access to a facility or a restricted area. <br />    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips</span>: Wear a fake badge to be more convincing. This because most organizations lack proper training for their staff when it comes to simple observation as to the validity of an ID badge. Moreover employees are wary of confrontation and often avoid asking someone to see the ID badge<br />    <span style="color:#a5452a;">examples:</span><br />      ▪ piggybacking: unauthorized person who follows someone to a restricted area(with or without his consent)<br />      ▪ shadowing: follow the movements of an authorized person</div>
