<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Zseano methodology</h1><br/><strong>Zseano Methodology</strong><br />There is a 99% chance the developer has created a filter as to what files to allow to upload and what to block.<br />The very first thing I will try to upload is:<br />   ◇ .txt<br />   ◇ .svg <br />   ◇ .xml<br />These three file types are sometimes forgotten about and slip through the filter.<br /><br /><strong>Indication of how the Web Application handle uploads:</strong><br />Are all the files uploaded saved in the same format regardless of the file type we uploaded?<br /><br /><strong>Testing file upload filenames</strong><br />The approach to testing file upload filenames is similar to XSS with testing various characters &amp; encoding. <br />It is all about providing it with malformed input &amp; seeing how much of that the Web Application trust.<br />What happens if you name the file:<br />   ◇ “daniele.php/.jpg” →  the code may see “.jpg” and think “ok” but the server actually writes it to the server as daniele.php and misses everything after the forward slash.<br />   ◇ &quot;daniele.html%0d%0a.jpg&quot; →  The server will see “.jpg” but because %0d%0a are newline characters it is saved as daniele.html<br />   ◇ &quot;daniele.jpg&lt;svg onload=confirm()&gt;&quot; → filenames could be reflected on the page and you can smuggle XSS characters in the filename<br />   ◇ “.jpg” → What happens if you provide it with NO filename?<br />   ◇ “daniele.” → What happens if we provide file with NO file extension?<br /><br /></div>
