    <h1 class='title'>Cryptographic Attacks</h1><br />The goal of <strong>Cryptographic Attacks</strong> is exploit
    weaknesses of crypto algorithms to decipher ciphertext without knowing the key<br /><br />Classification of
    Cryptographic Attacks:<br />• <strong>Known Only Attack</strong><br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Known Plaintext only attack</span>: access to the plaintext and the
    corresponding ciphertext<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Known Ciphertext only attack</span>: known
    only the ciphertext (no plaintext)<br />• <strong>Chosen Attack</strong><br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Chosen Plaintext attack</span>: the attacker has the ability to choose
    plaintexts and to view their corresponding encryption ciphertexts. <br /> The limitation is that is possible to do
    only a request(with inside more plaintexts)<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chosen Ciphertext
      attack</span>: attacker has the ability to choose ciphertexts and to view their corresponding decryption
    plaintexts. <br /> The limitation is that is possible to do only a request(with inside more chipertexts)<br /> It is
    essentially the same scenario as a Chosen Plaintext Attack but applied to a decryption function, instead of the
    encryption function<br />• <strong>Adaptive Chosen Attack</strong><br /> ◇ <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">Adaptive chosen plaintext attack</span>: it is a Chosen Plaintext Attack
    scenario in which the attacker has the ability to make his choice of the inputs to the encryption function<br />
    Differently from Chosen Plaintext attack is possible to do more request and therefore is possible base the new
    requests on previous responses<br /> ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Adaptive chosen ciphertext
      attack</span>: it is a Chosen Ciphertext Attack scenario in which the attacker has the ability to make his or her
    choice of the inputs to the decryption function<br /> Differently from Chosen Chiphertext attack is possible to do
    more request and therefore is possible base the new requests on previous
    responses<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a
