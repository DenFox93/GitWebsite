    <h1 class='title'>Methodology</h1><br />This section could be 1-10 pages.<br />A Methodology section makes the test
    more reproducible in the future. When the target organization in the future want redo the test, it can rely on this
    report to replicate it, performing a gap analysis on changes in the interim, or purposely tweak the process next
    time.<br /><br />• Provide a description of the step-by-step process used, and briefly list the findings discovered
    at each phase.<br />• Include a table to briefly summarize the tools used in the penetration test.<br />• Include a
    table with one row per target machine, listing the IP address, machine name(s), associated business unit (if it can
    be determined), and its method of discovery<br />• If there aren&#39;t many vulnerable findings, thid is a good news
    but could question the quality and completeness of the test.<br /> In these situations we need to provide even more
    detail in this Methodology section to show what we did during the test. <br /> That demonstrates we conducted a
    thorough test<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br />• <a
