<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Benchmark</h1><br/>John includes a handy function that measures the speed of a given system in cracking the various password hash routines that John can handle. <br />When invoked with the <strong>--test</strong> option, John can display statistics about how many combinations per second it can perform on a given machine. This option does not need any file passed as argument. Its only function is to benchmark the system john is running on.<br />Two results are included for each type of password hash: <br />   ◇ <strong><span style="color:#ff1b00;">real value</span></strong> → System with load: is an estimate of c/s for John given the presence of other processes that are vying for CPU time<br />   ◇ <strong><span style="color:#1e90ff;">virtual value</span></strong> → System without load: indicates how John is likely to perform if John can use most of the processing power of the system, without competing with other processes.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/737-1.png" alt="images/737-1.png" /></a></div>
