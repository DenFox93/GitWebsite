      href="https://www.openwall.com/john/" target="_blank">https://www.openwall.com/john/</a><br />Write a brute force script is
    relatively easy but some tools like <strong>John the Ripper</strong> (also called John or JtR) include helpful
    functions such as session saving and multi-threading support.<br /><br /><br />John the Ripper Pro, available for ~
    US$40. Most penetration testers use the free version, but the PRO version has some interesting options:<br /> ◇
    precompiled for various kinds of systems (some Linux distributions and macOS )<br /> ◇ autodetect performance
    enhancement technologies supported by the processor of the machine (MMX, SSE2,...)<br /> ▪ MultiMedia eXtension
    instructions (MMX) → designed originally to extend the standard x86 instruction set with new instructions to improve
    the speed of video operations for multimedia but can be used also to crack passwords<br /> ▪ Streaming Single SIMD
    Extensions 2 (SSE2)<br /> ◇ big multilingual word list (4.1 M entries)<br />John the Ripper in both Free and PRO
    version can be compiled in 64-bit mode, which likewise improves its performance.<br /><br /><strong>

    </div><br />OPTIONS:<br />All the options recognized by john start with a single dash &#39;-&#39;<br /> -incremental
    → brute force mode<br /><br /><strong>
      <h3>Combines account information from /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow</h3>
    </strong><br />An important thing to note is that <strong>/etc/shadow</strong> and <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> have
    some overlapping content. <br />John the Ripper&#39;s tool suite provides a nifty tool(<strong>unshadow</strong>) to
    merge these two files into one.<br />

      <h3>Interpreting the output</h3>
    </strong><br />While John is running, the user can press any key on the keyboard for a status check.<br />The status
    includes some fields:<br /> ◇ <strong>guesses</strong>: This is the number of passwords that John has successfully
    cracked so far since it was invoked.<br /> ◇ <strong>time</strong>: hours, minutes, and seconds that John has been
    running.<br /> ◇ <strong>percentage</strong>: indicates how much in percentage of the given mode John has made it
    through for Single crack and Wordlist modes only.<br /> ▪ Single crack mode is indicated on the display with a (1).
    <br /> ▪ Wordlist mode is indicated on the display with a (2). <br /> ▪ Incremental mode (John&#39;s brute force
    option) doesn&#39;t show a percentage. This mode is so long and time consuming that it would almost always say zero,
    so Solar Designer indicated that he didn&#39;t want to bother including it.<br /> ◇ <strong>c/s</strong>: This field
    indicates the password combinations per second that are being tried.<br /> ◇ <strong>trying</strong>: This last
    field tells the user the current guess that John is trying.<br /><br />To view the passwords that John has already
    cracked:<br />
